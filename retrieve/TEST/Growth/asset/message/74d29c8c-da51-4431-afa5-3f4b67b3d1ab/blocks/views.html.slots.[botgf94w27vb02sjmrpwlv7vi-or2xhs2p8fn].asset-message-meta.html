            >&nbsp;is a helpful defense against a potential cancer diagnosis, and we can help. At
            Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) in Zion, we continually
            strive to support the wellness of our community.<br />
            <br />
            We help our neighbors here in Lake County and beyond by delivering comprehensive,
            personalized treatments to those diagnosed with cancer.<br />
            <br />
            We also offer convenient access to routine screenings and can be your source for these
            important early detection assessments. A cancer screening is performed as a regular
            check for disease even in the absence of obvious signs or symptoms.<br />
