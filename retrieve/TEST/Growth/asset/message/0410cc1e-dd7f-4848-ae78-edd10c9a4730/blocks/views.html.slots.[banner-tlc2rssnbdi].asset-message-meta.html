            Dear Dr. %%LastName%%,<br />
            <br />
            As a director of gastroenterology services, I am committed to improving the quality of
            life for patients with gastrointestinal malignancies. As part of this commitment, I am
            proud to share that my colleagues and I have expanded our interventional
            gastroenterology offerings and now offer biliary radiofrequency ablation (RFA).<br />
            <br />
            Biliary RFA may be used in patients who are not candidates for chemotherapy or surgical
            management, or who have disease progression on chemotherapy. This safe and minimally
            invasive approach uses bipolar energy to partially or completely ablate malignant and
            benign tissue in the biliary tract, and to clear obstructed stents. Biliary RFA used
            prior to stent insertion can delay tumor growth, thereby improving patency of stents. It
            has the capability to improve patients&rsquo; quality of life and maintain disease
            control.<br />
            <br />
            If you feel one of your patients would be a candidate for biliary RFA, please feel free
            to contact me through this forum. I am practicing at Cancer Treatment Centers of America
            (CTCA), Tulsa. In addition, we are equipped to offer several other interventional
            gastroenterology procedures including photodynamic therapy (PDT), cryotherapy, small
            bowel enteroscopy and esophageal stenting. My team and I are committed to rapidly
            scheduling appointments, maintaining HIPAA-compliant communication with referring
            physicians, and appropriately and deliberately returning patients back into their care
            upon procedure completion.<br />
            <br />
            If you are unable to reach me during patient hours, please feel free to contact our
            Referral Team at 918-286-5900 or via encrypted email at

            Sincerely,<br />
