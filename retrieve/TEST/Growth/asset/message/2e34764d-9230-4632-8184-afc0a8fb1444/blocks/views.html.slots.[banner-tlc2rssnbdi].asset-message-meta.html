            Dear Dr. %%LastName%%,<br />
            <br />
            I want to personally share with you an upcoming CME opportunity in Tulsa, OK.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            The management of cancer patients is complex and requires the coordination of many
            clinical experts across a variety of disciplines. Further, new treatments and palliative
            methods are constantly emerging, bringing with them numerous side effects and
            interactions. Cancer Treatment Centers of America&nbsp;(CTCA), in partnership with the
            Academy for Continued Healthcare Learning and the Osteopathic Founders Foundation, is
            offering a free, live CME event at Oklahoma State University Health Science Center to
            discuss this topic on March 9, 2019 at 7:30 AM. I will be presenting, along with my
            colleagues from CTCA&nbsp;and MD Anderson.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            The fourth annual Advancements in Cancer Management will again address the most
            important topics affecting the management of cancer patients by general practitioners,
            highlighting the newest data and research. This series is consistently recognized by
            attendees as valuable education, with 99% of last years&rsquo; attendees saying they
            would recommend the course to a colleague and that all learning objectives were
            achieved.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            Upon completion of this CME event, the attendee will be able to:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Explain the use of multimodal analgesia to manage pain and reduce the use of

                <li>
