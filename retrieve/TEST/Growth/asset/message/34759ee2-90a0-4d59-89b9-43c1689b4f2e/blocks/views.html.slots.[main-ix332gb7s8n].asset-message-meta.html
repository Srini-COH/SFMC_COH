            Dear Dr. XXXX,<br />
            It has been a pleasure to work together with you on the care of your patients. I want to
            make you aware that I have recently joined Cancer Treatment Centers of America&reg;
            (CTCA), practicing at the CTCA&reg; Outpatient Care Center in Scottsdale. I would be
            honored to continue to work with you to deliver exceptional service and specialized care
            for your oncology patients.<br />
            CTCA is a comprehensive cancer care network that serves adult patients. We offer
            surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, interventional oncology, genomic
            testing and precision cancer treatment. We practice evidence-based medicine, and at the
            same time, support patients&rsquo; overall well-being with supportive therapies designed
            to enhance quality of life while managing side effects.<br />
            As you may know, CTCA recently expanded its services through two new Outpatient Care
            Centers in the Phoenix area, offering the same high-quality, safe and compassionate care
            we provide at our hospitals in a convenient outpatient setting. Additionally, we are
            proud to work with a multitude of payers to expand access for patients, including
            Medicare. Below, please find two pieces that provide additional information about CTCA
            and the outpatient care centers.
