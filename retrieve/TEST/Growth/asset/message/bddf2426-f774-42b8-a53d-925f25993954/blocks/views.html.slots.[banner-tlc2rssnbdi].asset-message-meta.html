            that found stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) may double five-year survival in
            oligometastatic cancers. The findings were presented at the latest Annual Meeting of the
            American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO).<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            According to ASTRO, &ldquo;In the first randomized, phase II clinical trial of its kind,
            researchers have shown that an aggressive form of high-precision radiation therapy can
            greatly increase how long oligometastatic patients live and doubles how long they live
            without cancer.&rdquo; Some suggest this is the biggest news in radiation oncology in
            quite some time.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            As the Chief of Radiation Oncology at Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA),
            Atlanta, I am enthusiastic about these findings and want to share that CTCA Atlanta is
            offering a Multidisciplinary Oligometastatic Management Program (MOM Program), which
            includes SBRT as well as surgical resection options.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            Should you have oligometastatic patients you believe would benefit from the MOM Program,
            I am available to work with you on exploring options for their care. I can usually see
            patients in the same week of the referral. &nbsp;As patientsâ€™ care would be managed by
            you as the medical oncologist, and our team for radiation or surgical intervention, we
            are committed to HIPAA-compliant communication throughout the span of treatment.
            Additionally, once treatment is complete, we will appropriately and deliberately return
            patients back into your care.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            At CTCA, we believe that exceptional care is built and nurtured through clinical
            collaboration and effective communication.&nbsp; The MOM Program provides us with an
            excellent opportunity to work together with medical oncologists to expand additional
            care options for patients.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            If you have questions about our program or would like to refer a patient, please contact
            me at 770-400-6518.&nbsp; If you need to reach someone immediately, my Physician
            Referral Specialist is available at 770-400-6568 or
