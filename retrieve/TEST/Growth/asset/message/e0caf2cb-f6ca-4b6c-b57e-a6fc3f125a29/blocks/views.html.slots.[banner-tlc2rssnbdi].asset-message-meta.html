            Dear Dr.&nbsp;%%LastName%%,<br />
            <br />
            Recently, NCCN guidelines included
            <a

                conversion="false"

            as an accepted option at the time of interval debulking surgery for patients with stage
            III epithelial ovarian cancer.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            According to an article published in the January 2018 issue of The New England Journal
            of Medicine (NEJM) titled &ldquo;Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy in Ovarian
            Cancer,&rdquo; those who received HIPEC demonstrated a 12-month improvement in median
            overall survival. The article reflected a randomized clinical trial from the
            Netherlands, and focused on patients with stage III epithelial ovarian cancer.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            At Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA) in suburban Chicago, our surgeons are
            experienced and highly skilled in administering HIPEC and optimal debulking to support
            the management of ovarian cancer. Collectively, our team has performed hundreds of HIPEC
            procedures over the past decade. By nature, cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and HIPEC rely
            on a collaborative clinical environment. At CTCA, every patient with peritoneal surface
            malignancy is attended by a multidisciplinary team, including gynecologic oncologists,
            surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, pain management specialists, and integrative
            services team members to help patients manage side effects and return to daily
            activities as quickly as possible. Additionally, we are committed to rapidly scheduling
            appointments upon referral and appropriately transitioning patients back into your care
            once treatment is complete.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
