            Dear Dr. %%LastName%%,<br />
            <br />

                    >Our practice is currently participating in a clinical research study testing an
                    intravenous investigational medication in adults for the treatment
                    <i
                        >of High-Risk Early-Stage Estrogen Receptor-Positive, Human Epidermal Growth
                        Factor Receptor 2-Negative (ER+/HER2&ndash;) Breast Cancer (KEYNOTE-756)</i
                    >. We are testing an immunotherapeutic agent called Pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab
                    targets a protein called PD-1 found on some cells of the immune system.
                    Pembrolizumab blocks the interaction of PD-1 with another protein called PD-L1,
                    sometimes found on tumor cells.<br />
                    <br />
                    I am writing you to make you aware of this trial, as you may be able to help us
                    identify patients who might be eligible to participate in this study. This is a
                    first line study and as such we are looking to identify patients at the point of
                    diagnosis. We encourage you to proactively screen for any of your patients who
                    may qualify.<br />
                    <br />
                    For the study, patients will receive 200 mg pembrolizumab (MK-3475) every 3
                    weeks plus chemotherapy versus placebo plus chemotherapy as neoadjuvant
                    treatment. After definitive surgery, patients will receive pembrolizumab plus
                    endocrine therapy versus placebo plus endocrine therapy as adjuvant
                    treatment.<br />
                    <br />
                    Patients will be treated until one of the following occurs: a specific number of
                    treatment cycles have been completed, disease progression, unacceptable adverse
                    experience, intercurrent illness which prevents further treatment,
                    Investigator&rsquo;s decision to withdraw the patient, patient withdraws
                    consent, pregnancy of the patient, noncompliance with trial treatment or
                    procedures or administrative reasons.<br />
                    <br />
                    <b><i>What Can Your Patient Expect? </i></b><br />
                    <br />
                    Patients will have study visits approximately every two to three weeks during
                    study treatment. During these visits to my office, patients will receive
                    study-related medical care, including medication, blood tests, physical
                    examinations and radiological tumor assessments. Our study staff will be there
                    to offer support and answer questions throughout the study.<br />
                    <br />
                    Should you know of any individuals that meet the criteria below and who may be
                    interested in participating in such a study, please ask him/her to call Marianne
                    Bonner, BSN, RN at 215-537-4881 for more information.<br />
