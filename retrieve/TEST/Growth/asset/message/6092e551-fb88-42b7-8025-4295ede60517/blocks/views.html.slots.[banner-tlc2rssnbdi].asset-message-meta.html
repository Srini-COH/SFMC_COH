            Dear Dr. %%LastName%%,<br />
            <br />
            A little over a year ago, Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA) opened the
            Outpatient Care Center in downtown Chicago on East Illinois Street between North
            Michigan Avenue and North Columbus Drive. As we celebrate our anniversary, I wanted to
            reach out and share with you our service offerings.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            At our Outpatient Care Center, we offer a multidisciplinary team of experienced
            oncologists, dedicated to clinical excellence and patient-centered care. We are
            available to evaluate patients of all cancer types and offer radiation therapy
            (including CyberKnife robotic radiosurgery), medical oncology services, chemotherapy,
            precision medicine, immunotherapy and surgical consultations. Alongside practicing
            evidence-based medicine, we also offer evidence-informed integrated and support services
            designed to enhance patients&rsquo; quality of life while managing side effects during
            and after treatment.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            Below, please find additional information about the Outpatient Care Center services and
            physicians:
