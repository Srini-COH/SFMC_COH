            Dear Dr. %%LastName%%,<br />
            <br />
            The National Cancer Institute predicts that breast cancer incidence rates will rise 50
            percent by 2030. In response, my colleagues and I developed a multidisciplinary
            high-risk breast cancer program.<br />
            <br />
            Patients who are considered at higher risk for developing breast cancer include those
            with:
            <ul>
                <li>A personal history of breast or ovarian cancer</li>
                <li>A first-degree relative diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer</li>
                <li>
                    A family history with multiple members diagnosed with breast, ovarian, prostate
                    and/or pancreatic cancer
                </li>
                <li>
                    An abnormal finding after a breast biopsy including atypical ductal hyperplasia
                    (ADH), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) or atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH)
                </li>
                <li>A history of carcinogen exposure (e.g., previous radiation therapy)</li>
                <li>
                    A known genetic mutation or risk factors which may predispose them to a genetic
                    mutation
                </li>
            </ul>
            In our practice at Cancer Treatment Centers of America, Atlanta, we provide a
            comprehensive clinical program including risk assessment, diagnostics, genetic
            counseling and testing, surgical risk-reduction strategies, prevention guidance and
            active surveillance. Our team is committed to rapidly scheduling appointments, often
            seeing patients within a week of referral. We are also dedicated to keeping referring
            physicians updated through HIPAA-compliant communications on their patients&rsquo;
            status, as well as appropriately and deliberately transitioning patients back into their
            care.<br />
