            Dear Dr. %%LastName%%,<br />
            <br />
            It is estimated that 80% of cancer patients experience disease-related pain.<br />
            <br />
            When not managed, cancer pain can adversely affect treatment outcomes and quality of
            life, including additional hospitalizations, increased health care costs, as well as
            lack of adherence to and/or delayed treatment.<br />
            <br />
            As a board certified and fellowship-trained pain management physician with expertise in
            treating cancer patients, I can be a resource to you for your patients struggling with
            cancer-related pain.<br />
            <br />
            In my practice at Cancer Treatment Centers of America, Atlanta, we provide care for
            episodic and advanced cancer-related pain utilizing a multimodal approach and
            interventions through both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical approaches as
            appropriate, including minimally invasive procedures such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Bone tumor ablation</li>
                <li>Vertebra augmentation</li>
                <li>Systematic nerve blocks</li>
                <li>Neuromodulation</li>
                <li>Musculoskeletal injections</li>
                <li>Facet joint injections</li>
                <li>Radiofrequency ablation/thermoneurolysis/denervation</li>
                <li>Peripheral nerve blocks</li>
                <li>Joint injections</li>
                <li>Bursa injections</li>
            </ul>
            When opioid medications are necessary, we closely monitor patients for signs of
            dependency and rapidly respond to alternatives as needed.<br />
            <br />
            Recognizing the urgency of effectively treating patients&rsquo; pain, our team has made
            it a priority to rapidly schedule patients, sometimes seeing them within three days of
            referral. If you send a patient to us, please know that we are committed to
            HIPAA-compliant communications with you as the patient&rsquo;s primary oncology provider
            to assist with continuity of care.<br />
            <br />

            specialist team is available at 770-400-6568 or via encrypted email to
