            Dear Dr. %%LastName%%,<br />
            <br />
            While neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) account for less than one percent of gastrointestinal
            malignancies, the incidence of occurrence is rising. NETs are rare, often present with a
            variety of clinical behaviors, and can be complex to manage based on varying degrees of
            disease aggressiveness. At Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA), Chicago, our
            multidisciplinary team has extensive experience in the diagnosis and management of NETs
            and would welcome you to consider us as a resource.<br />
            <br />
            Recently, we expanded our NET program and now offer both NETSPOT (gallium Ga 68
            dotatate), a diagnostic imaging agent to help detect NETs, as well as LUTATHERA
            (lutetium Lu 17 dotatate), the first FDA-approved Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy
            (PRRT) designed to specifically treat somatostatin receptor positive
            gastroenteropancreatic NETs.<br />
            <br />
            We understand the urgency in effectively treating patients with NETs and can rapidly
            schedule appointments, often within the week of referral. Our team is committed to
            HIPAA-compliant communication throughout treatment, and once complete, we will
            appropriately and deliberately transition patients back into your care.<br />
            <br />
            I am available to answer questions or to evaluate patients. Please don&rsquo;t hesitate
            to contact me. Additionally, my referral team is available when I am with patients at
            847-746-9990 or via encrypted email at

            <br />
            Sincerely,<br />
