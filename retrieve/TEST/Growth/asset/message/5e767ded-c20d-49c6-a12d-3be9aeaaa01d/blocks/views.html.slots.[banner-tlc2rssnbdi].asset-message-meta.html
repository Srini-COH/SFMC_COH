            Dear Dr. %%LastName%%,<br />
            <br />
            I want to personally share with you an upcoming multidisciplinary CME event for primary
            care and specialists providing care to patients with cancer.&nbsp; This no cost event
            will be held in Rosemont, IL.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            The management of cancer patients, specifically the medical sequelae of their treatment
            and disease, is increasingly complex requiring the collaboration of clinical experts
            across a variety of disciplines. Promising new treatments are rapidly emerging, bringing
            with them new side effects and interactions with many common organ systems typically
            managed by other specialties. You deserve to be better informed about these new
            treatments, and the management of their side effects.&nbsp; There are also tremendous
            advances in pain management and in the complications of cancer that you should hear
            about.&nbsp; Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA), in partnership with the Academy
            for Continued Healthcare Learning and the Osteopathic Founders Foundation, is offering a
            free, live CME event at Gene and Georgetti, Rosemont, to discuss these topics on May 4,
            2019 at 7:30 a.m. My colleagues from CTCA and The University of Texas MD Anderson will
            be presenting.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            The fourth annual Advancements in Cancer Management will again address the most
            important topics affecting the management of cancer patients by general practitioners,
            highlighting the newest data and research. This series is consistently recognized by
            attendees as valuable education, with 99% of last years&rsquo; attendees saying they
            would recommend the course to a colleague and that all learning objectives were
            achieved.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            Upon completion of this CME event, the attendee will be able to:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Evaluate immuno-oncology approaches in cancer treatment, including patient
                    selection and side effect management.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Explain the use of multimodal analgesia to manage pain and reduce the use of
                    opioids in cancer patients.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Describe how integrative therapies and lifestyle change programs are employed as
                    adjunct therapies in the care of cancer patients
                </li>
                <li>
                    Describe the appropriate follow-up protocols for identification of pulmonary
                    nodules
                </li>
                <li>
                    Recognize the pathophysiology and clinical presentations of various subtypes of
                    pleural effusions and their management.
                </li>
            </ul>
            I hope to see you at this event. Feel free to share this invitation with others you feel
            may benefit from learning more about the management of cancer patients and participating
            in this educational program.<br />
