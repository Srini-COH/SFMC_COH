                        It has been a pleasure to work together with you on the care of your
                        patients. I want to make you aware that I am now practicing at Cancer
                        Treatment Centers of America (CTCA), both at the Comprehensive Care and
                        Research Center in Goodyear and at the Outpatient Care Center in Scottsdale.
