            %%FIRSTNAME%%, we&rsquo;re glad we could help get you vaccinated!<br />
            <br />
            While public vaccinations are not a norm for us, helping our neighbors here in Lake
            County during this global health crisis was too important; we knew we had to take
            action. We&rsquo;d like to thank you for choosing Cancer Treatment Centers of
            America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) in Zion, IL, for your COVID-19 vaccination.<br />
            <br />
            In the spirit of taking proactive health measures, we want you to know that

            against a potential cancer diagnosis, and we can help.<br />
            <br />
            According to a survey by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN),
            more than two-thirds of Americans reported delaying or skipping their scheduled cancer
            screenings, such as mammograms and colonoscopies, during the COVID-19 crisis.<br />
            <br />
            Here at CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup> in Zion, we continually strive to support the wellness of
            our community&mdash;and we do that best by delivering comprehensive, personalized
            treatments to those who&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with cancer. You may not know this, but
            we also offer convenient access to routine screenings, and we can be your source for
            these important early detection tools. A cancer screening is performed as a regular
            check for disease even in the absence of obvious signs or symptoms.<br />
