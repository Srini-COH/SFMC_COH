Studies* have shown that screening high-risk individuals with low-dose CT scans could reduce lung cancer mortality by 20 percent, so I’m pleased to share that the CTCA(R) facility in Tulsa is now offering services for lung cancer screening and diagnosis.\n\n \n\nThe U.S. Preventative Task Force recommends annual screening for lung cancer with a low-dose CT scan for the following patients:\n \n  55 to 80 years old\n  30+ pack-year smoking history\n  Currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years \n\nOur program offers:\n \n  Quick Appointments – Patients are typically seen the same week they call for an appointment.\n  Rapid Results – Screening results are delivered to you and your patient quickly, often within 48 hours.\n  Access to Specialists – If your patient needs additional follow-up, CTCA offers quick access to a multidisciplinary team of board-certified interventional radiologists and pulmonologists as well as thoracic surgeons to diagnose and manage any aspect of thoracic malignancy.\n  Patient Follow-up – Our screening software system helps ensure patients don’t miss crucial follow-up appointments and that you are notified of the latest with their care.\n \nPlease find a lung cancer screening guideline poster that a few of your colleagues requested to share with patients here\nhttps://www.cancercenter.com/~/media/Collateral%20Vault/Posters/3769_Lung_Cancer_Screening_Guidelines_Vault.pdf\n.\n \nAdditionally, if you have questions or would like us to evaluate one of your patients, you may contact me at (918)286-5900. Or if you need to reach me during patient hours, please contact our Referral Team at (918)286-5900 or ok-referrals@ctca-hope.com\nmailto:ok-referrals@ctca-hope.com?subject=Lung%20cancer%20screening%20request\n.\n\n \n%%=ContentBlockbyID(\"21224\")=%%\n \n*The National Lung Cancer Screening Trial.
