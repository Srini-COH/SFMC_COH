            Dear Dr. %%LastName%%,<br />
            <br />
            I recently relocated to Tulsa and am taking this opportunity to personally introduce
            myself to you and surrounding health care professionals. As a fellowship-trained head
            and neck and microvascular reconstruction surgeon who specializes in maxillofacial
            surgery, I am looking forward to the opportunity to work together to improve the quality
            of life for cancer patients.<br />
            <br />
            As the new Director of Head and Neck Surgery and Microvascular Reconstruction at Cancer
            Treatment Centers of America (CTCA), Tulsa, I will provide surgical management and
            reconstruction for head and neck cancers, including vascularized free tissue
            transfer.<br />
            <br />
            As one of only two hospitals in Oklahoma, and the only in Tulsa, I will also offer
            Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS) with the Flex Robotic System.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
