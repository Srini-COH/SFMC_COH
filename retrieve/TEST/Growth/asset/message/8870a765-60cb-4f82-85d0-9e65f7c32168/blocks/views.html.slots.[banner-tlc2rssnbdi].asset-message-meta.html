            Dear Dr. %%LastName%%,<br />
            <br />
            I am reaching out to you regarding possible collaboration in caring for patients with
            neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). At Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA), Chicago, we
            recently expanded our multidisciplinary NET program to offer Peptide Receptor
            Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT).<br />
            <br />
            CTCA Chicago, located between Milwaukee and Chicago, is one of six hospitals in Illinois
            to provide LUTATHERA (lutetium Lu 177 dotatate), the first FDA-approved PRRT designed to
            specifically treat somatostatin receptor position gastroenteropancreatic NETs.
            Importantly, this treatment is approved as a second-line therapy per NCCN guidelines,
            after patients have progressed on a first-line somatostatin analog (SSA).<br />
            <br />
            We recognize the urgency in effectively treating patients with NETs and can rapidly
            schedule appointments, often within a week of referral. If you send a patient to us,
            please know that we are committed to HIPAA-compliant communications with you, the
            patient&rsquo;s medical oncologist, throughout the span of NET treatment. Additionally,
            once PRRT is complete, we will appropriately and deliberately return patients back into
            your care.<br />
            <br />
            I am available to answer questions or discuss patient cases you feel might be
            appropriate for PRRT. Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact me. Additionally, my
            referral team is available when I am with patients at 847-746-9990 or via encrypted
            email at
            <a href="mailto:IL-referrals@ctca-hope.com">IL-referrals@ctca-hope.com</a>.<br />
            <br />
            Sincerely,<br />
