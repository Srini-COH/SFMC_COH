                        >I would appreciate the opportunity to be considered a resource to you for
                        head and neck malignancies. Being a part of a multidisciplinary team that
                        uses an evidence-based and integrated approach to diagnose, treat and
                        palliate the disease is one of the reasons I recently relocated to join
                        Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA) in Tulsa as the Director of Head
                        and Neck Surgery and Microvascular Reconstruction. Among the multiple
                        diagnostics and treatments offered by our team is transoral robotic
                        surgery.</span

                        >Through this minimally invasive surgical approach, anatomical locations
                        typically difficult to reach, including areas of the oropharynx, the
                        hypopharynx and the larynx, can be accessed. Operation occurs directly
                        through a patient&rsquo;s natural orifices, reducing the necessity for a
                        large incision in the neck, which may lead to a quicker recovery, shorter
                        hospital stays, reduced post-surgical pain, reduced risk of infection and
                        complications, and less blood loss and scarring. Currently, in my practice
                        at CTCA Tulsa, we are one of only two hospitals in Oklahoma to offer
                        transoral robotic surgery via the Flex Robotic System.</span
