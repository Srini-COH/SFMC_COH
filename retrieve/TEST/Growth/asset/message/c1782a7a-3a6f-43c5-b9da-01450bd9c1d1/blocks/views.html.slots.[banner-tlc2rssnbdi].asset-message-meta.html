            Dear Dr. %%LastName%%,<br />
            <br />
            The National Cancer Institute predicts that breast cancer incident rates will rise 50
            percent by 2030. In response, my colleagues at Cancer Treatment Centers of America
            (CTCA), Phoenix and I have developed a multidisciplinary high-risk breast cancer
            program.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            Patients who are considered at higher risk for developing breast cancer include those
            with:
            <ul>
                <li>A first-degree relative diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer</li>
                <li>
                    A family history with multiple members diagnosed with breast, ovarian, prostate
                    and/or pancreatic cancer
                </li>
                <li>
                    An abnormal finding after a breast biopsy, particularly atypical ductal
                    hyperplasia (ADH), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) or atypical lobular
                    hyperplasia (ALH)
                </li>
                <li>A history of carcinogen exposure (e.g., previous radiation therapy)</li>
                <li>
                    A known genetic mutation or risk factors which may predispose them to a genetic
                    mutation
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            At CTCA Phoenix, we provide a comprehensive clinical program including risk assessment,
            diagnostics, genetic counseling and testing, surgical risk-reduction strategies,
            prevention guidance and active surveillance. Our team is committed to rapidly scheduling
            appointments, often seeing patients within a week of referral. We are also committed to
            keep referring physicians updated through HIPAA-compliant communications on their
            patients&rsquo; status, as well as appropriately and deliberately transition patients
            back into their care.<br />
