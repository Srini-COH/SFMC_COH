                        I want to share that Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA) Tulsa is now
                        equipped with new capabilities to access hard-to-reach, small peripheral
                        lung nodules. This innovative minimally-invasive endoscopic technology is
                        part of our growing interventional pulmonology program.<br />

                        CTCA Tulsa is the only hospital west of the Mississippi River and the only
                        hospital in Oklahoma to offer the

                        bronchoscopic procedures. This approach is designed to overcome previous
                        virtual navigation limitations by allowing more flexibility and direct video
                        visualization to help reach challenging areas in the lung. Avoiding
                        unnecessary transthoracic needle aspirations for biopsies and decreasing the
                        risk of major complications, including pneumothorax, is one of goals of this
                        technique. In addition, it may enable therapeutic lung interventions, such
                        as radiofrequency ablation, fiducial marker placement, cryotherapy and
                        photodynamic therapy.<br />

                        If you are unable to access the area of concern via bronchoscopy or need to
                        do a transthoracic needle aspiration for your lung cancer patients, please
                        feel free to contact me to see if he/she would benefit from this new
                        minimally-invasive procedure. My team and I are committed to rapidly
                        scheduling appointments and maintaining HIPAA-compliant communication with
                        referring physicians, while also appropriately returning patients back into
                        their care.<br />
