            Dear Dr. %%LastName%%,<br />
            <br />
            I am connecting with you to offer treatment options for Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus. I
            have practiced in the Chicago area for nearly three decades and specialize in the
            diagnosis and treatment of the condition, which in select patient populations, can
            become malignant. As part of our cancer prevention efforts, the Cancer Treatment Centers
            of America (CTCA) interventional gastroenterology team in suburban Chicago developed a
            comprehensive treatment program for Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            In recent years, several guidelines published by the American College of
            Gastroenterology recommend endoscopic ablative therapy for patients with Barrett&rsquo;s
            esophagus, high-grade dysplasia and T1a esophageal adenocarcinoma.*&nbsp; An example of
            this evolution in approach to care is the recent approval of cryotherapy for low- and
            high-grade dysplasia. Additionally, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and endoscopic mucosal
            resection (EMR) are also approved ablation options. At CTCA, we offer all three
            approaches with a commitment to:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Quick appointments &ndash; Patients are typically seen the same week they are
                    referred for an appointment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Thorough evaluation &ndash; Dependent upon previous tests conducted at your
                    office, patients will likely be seen for a one-day evaluation that includes an
                    endoscopy and biopsy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prompt treatment &ndash; If appropriate for treatment, patients who are
                    pre-certified will be scheduled for an ablative therapy no later than 30 days
                    following the evaluation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Strong communication &ndash; I commit to keeping you updated on your referred
                    patient&rsquo;s status via HIPAA-compliant communication throughout the
                    evaluation process and treatment. Once treatment is complete, I will work with
                    you to appropriately transition patients back into your care.
                </li>
            </ul>
            If you have a patient who is at high-risk for, or who has been diagnosed with
            Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus and you would like to determine if they are a candidate for
            treatment, please contact me through this forum. Additionally, if you need to reach me
            urgently during patient hours, please contact our Referral team at (847)746-9990 or
