                        I want to personally share with you an upcoming CME opportunity in Phoenix,
                        AZ.<br />
                        &nbsp;<br />
                        Palliation of dysphagia in esophageal cancer patients is complex and new
                        evidence is being published about the effectiveness of emerging therapies,
                        alone and in combination with existing treatments, which may lead to changes
                        in best practice.<br />
                        &nbsp;<br />
                        Cancer Treatment Centers of America, in partnership with the Academy for
                        Continued Healthcare Learning, is offering a free, live CME event and dinner
                        at Ocean 44 to discuss this topic on February 21, 2019 at 6:00 PM. I will be
                        presenting, along with my colleague from Banner MD Anderson, Madappa
                        Kundranda, MD, PhD, FACP.<br />
                        &nbsp;<br />
                        Upon completion of this CME event, the attendee will be able to:<br />

                                Select the appropriate modality for management of dysphagia in an
