                        The National Cancer Institute predicts that breast cancer incidence rates
                        will rise 50 percent by 2030. Understanding early detection is critical, my
                        colleagues at Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA), Phoenix and I have
                        developed a multidisciplinary high-risk breast cancer program.<br />
                        &nbsp;<br />
                        Patients who are considered at higher risk for developing breast cancer
                        include those with:<br />
                        &nbsp;
                        <ul>
                            <li>A first-degree relative diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer</li>
                            <li>
                                A family history with multiple members diagnosed with breast,
                                ovarian, prostate and/or pancreatic cancer
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                An abnormal finding after a breast biopsy, particularly atypical
                                ductal hyperplasia (ADH), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) or
                                atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A history of carcinogen exposure (e.g., previous radiation therapy)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A known genetic mutation or risk factors which may predispose them
                                to a genetic mutation
                            </li>

                        At CTCA Phoenix, we provide a comprehensive clinical program including risk
                        assessment, diagnostics, genetic counseling and testing, surgical
                        risk-reduction strategies, prevention guidance and active surveillance. Our
                        team is committed to rapidly scheduling appointments, often seeing patients
                        within a week of referral. We are also dedicated to keep referring
                        physicians updated through HIPAA-compliant communications on their
                        patients&rsquo; status, as well as appropriately and deliberately transition
                        patients back into their care.<br />
