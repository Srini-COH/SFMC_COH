            Dear Dr. %%LastName%%,<br />
            <br />
            It has been a pleasure to work together with you on the care of your patients. I want to
            make you aware that I have recently joined Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA),
            practicing at the CTCA Outpatient Care Center in Scottsdale. I would be honored to
            continue to work with you to deliver exceptional service and specialized care for your
            oncology patients.<br />
            <br />
            You may already be familiar with CTCA, a comprehensive cancer care network that serves
            adult patients. We offer surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, interventional
            oncology, genomic testing and precision cancer treatment. We practice evidence-based
            medicine, and at the same time, support patients&rsquo; overall well-being with
            supportive therapies designed to enhance quality of life while managing side effects.<br />
            <br />
            CTCA recently expanded its services through two new Outpatient Care Centers in the
            Valley and accepts multiple commercial insurances in addition to Medicare. I am caring
            for patients at the Scottsdale location near the intersections of North 90th Street and
            East Mountain View Road. Below, please find additional information about CTCA.&nbsp;
