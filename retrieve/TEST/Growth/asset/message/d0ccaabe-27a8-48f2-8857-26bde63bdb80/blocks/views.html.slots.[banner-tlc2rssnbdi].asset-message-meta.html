            Dear Dr. %%LastName%%,<br />
            <br />
            It is estimated that 80% of cancer patients experience disease-related pain. In my
            practice, I have primarily managed cancer patients&rsquo; pain with evidence-based
            interventions. However, with a goal to improve the lives of all patients, my colleague,
            George Macrinici, MD and I have recently expanded our services to include all patients
            with back pain, regardless of a malignant diagnosis.<br />
            <br />
            Both Dr. Macrinici and I are fellowship trained and board certified in pain management.
            We perform a variety of interventional pain management techniques that focus on
            improving quality of life utilizing both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic
            interventions. Some of the minimally-invasive procedures we offer include:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Radiofrequency ablation:</b>&nbsp;implant-free procedure that uses bipolar
                    radiofrequency energy to ablate the basivertebral nerve for chronic low back
                    pain
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b
                        >Pain signal-blocking procedures (including dorsal root ganglion, spinal
                        cord and peripheral nerve stimulation):</b
                    >
                    placement of a stimulator to disrupt pain signals to the brain
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Intrathecal baclofen therapy (ITB):</b> implantation of a pump to deliver
                    continuous doses of baclofen directly into the spinal fluid, eliminating the
                    need for oral baclofen for spinal cord injury patients
                </li>
            </ul>
            Dr. Macrinici and I practice at Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA) in Zion, IL,
            which is located midway between Chicago and Milwaukee. We are committed to rapidly
            scheduling appointments upon referral, keeping referring physicians updated through
            HIPAA-compliant communications, and appropriately transitioning patients back into their
            care once a procedure is complete.<br />
            <br />
            If you have patients who have failed other chronic back pain treatments that you feel
            would benefit from one of these options, we would be happy to talk with you further.
            Please feel free to reach out to me directly. If your message is urgent during patient
            hours, our Referral Specialist team is available at 847-746-9990 or via encrypted email
            to <a href="mailto:IL-referrals@ctca-hope.com">IL-referrals@ctca-hope.com</a>.<br />
            <br />
            Regards,<br />
