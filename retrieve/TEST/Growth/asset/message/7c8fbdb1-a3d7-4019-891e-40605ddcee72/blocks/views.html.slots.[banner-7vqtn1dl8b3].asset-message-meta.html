            Dear Dr. %%LastName%%,<br />
            <br />
            Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are becoming more common, with incidence of occurrence
            rising nearly 90 percent over the last decade. Although NETs comprise less than one
            percent of gastrointestinal malignancies, they are second only to colorectal cancer and
            the third most common cancer in the U.S. Because of the increasing prevalence of these
            tumors and our expertise in treating them, I wanted to connect and share new information
            about our multidisciplinary Neuroendocrine Tumor (NET) Clinical Program at Cancer
            Treatment Centers of America (CTCA), Atlanta.<br />
            <br />
            CTCA Atlanta is the first hospital in Georgia to offer the first FDA-approved Peptide
            Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT), LUTATHERA, for treatment of somatostatin receptor
            positive gastroenteropancreatic NETs. I welcome the opportunity to collaborate with you
            in the care of patients with NETs who may benefit from this offering. Importantly, this
            treatment is approved as a second-line therapy, per NCCN guidelines, after patients have
            progressed on a first-line somatostatin analog (SSA).<br />
            <br />
            We understand the sense of urgency in effectively treating patients with NETs and are
            able to rapidly schedule patients, often seeing them within the week of referral. As
            patients&rsquo; care would be managed by you as the medical oncologist, and our team for
            the PRRT, we are committed to HIPAA-compliant communication throughout the span of
            treatment. Additionally, once PRRT is complete, we will appropriately and deliberately
            return patients back into your care.<br />
            <br />
            I am available to answer any questions or to evaluate patients you feel may benefit from
            this offering. Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact me via email or on my cell at
            561-305-6059. Additionally, my referral team is available when I am with patients at
            770-400-6568 or via encrypted email at
