                >Dear Dr. %%LastName%%,<br />
                <br />
                As the Medical Director of the Lung Cancer Center at Cancer Treatment Centers of
                America&nbsp;(CTCA) in Tulsa, I am focused on how to best fight and treat lung
                cancer. Studies* have shown that screening high-risk individuals with low-dose CT
                scans could reduce lung cancer mortality by 20 percent, so Iâ€™m pleased to share that
                the CTCA&nbsp;facility in Tulsa is now offering services for lung cancer screening
                and diagnosis.<br />
                &nbsp;<br />
                The U.S. Preventative Task Force recommends annual screening for lung cancer with a
                low-dose CT scan for the following patients:</span

                    <span style="font-size: 12px">55 to 80 years old</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span style="font-size: 12px">30+ pack-year smoking history</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span style="font-size: 12px"
                        >Currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years</span

                        patients don&rsquo;t miss crucial follow-up appointments and that you are
                        notified of the latest with their care.</span
