            Dear Dr. %%LastName%%,<br />
            <br />
            As the Director of Interventional Pulmonology at Cancer Treatment Centers of America
            (CTCA) in Suburban Chicago, I am focused on how to best fight lung cancer. Studies* have
            shown that screening high-risk individuals with low-dose CT scans could reduce lung
            cancer mortality by 20 percent, so I&rsquo;m pleased to share that the CTCA facility in
            Chicago offers services for lung cancer screening and diagnosis.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            The U.S. Preventative Task Force recommends annual screening for lung cancer with a
            low-dose CT scan for the following patients:
            <ul>
                <li>55 to 80 years old</li>
                <li>30+ pack-year smoking history</li>
                <li>Currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years</li>
            </ul>
            Our program offers:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Quick Appointments &ndash; Patients are typically seen the same week they call
                    for an appointment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rapid Results &ndash; Screening results are delivered to you and your patient
                    quickly, often within 48 hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Patient Follow-up &ndash; Our screening software system helps ensure patients
                    don&rsquo;t miss crucial follow-up appointments and that you are notified of the
                    latest with their care.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Access to Specialists &ndash; If your patient needs additional follow-up, we
                    offer quick access to a multidisciplinary team of board-certified interventional
                    radiologists and pulmonologists as well as thoracic surgeons and medical
                    oncologists to diagnose and manage any aspect of thoracic malignancy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fast Diagnosis &ndash; We are equipped to provide safe, minimally-invasive
                    procedures, such as endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with electromagnetic
                    navigation (ENB) bronchoscopy, to biopsy suspicious nodules, providing a
                    diagnosis in as little as 72 hours.
                </li>
            </ul>
