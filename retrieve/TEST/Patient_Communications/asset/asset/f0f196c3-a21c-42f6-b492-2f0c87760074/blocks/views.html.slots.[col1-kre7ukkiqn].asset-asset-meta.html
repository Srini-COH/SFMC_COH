                        Now that you have scheduled your appointment at CTCA, this short video will
                        help you understand the benefits of our integrated approach to cancer care.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, you may want to know, how will your treatment at CTCA differ
                        from the treatment you would receive elsewhere? Or, how can you feel better
                        while fighting cancer?
                    </p>
                    <p>Our hope is that this video will help answer some of those questions.</p>
                    <p>
                        It’s important to recognize that treating cancer with state-of-the-art tools
                        is only one step in the fight. The disease and its treatment may also take a
                        toll on your body, mind&nbsp;and spirit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That’s why the comprehensive treatment plan you will receive following your
                        evaluation at CTCA will include both conventional cancer treatments (such as
                        surgery, radiation&nbsp;and chemotherapy) and evidence-informed supportive
                        therapies (such as nutritional support, physical therapy&nbsp;and
                        naturopathic therapy).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These supportive therapies may help you manage possible side effects (like
                        fatigue, nausea&nbsp;and pain), avoid delays in treatment and maintain your
                        quality of life during treatment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We call this approach integrative cancer care. It is designed to help
                        patients feel better during treatment and get back to life quicker.
                    </p>

                        treatment at CTCA is likely to differ from the treatment you would receive

                            To prepare for your evaluation, your medical oncologist reviews your
                            medical records and notes from your Nurse Navigator. Your clinical
                            situation is also presented to an integrative team that represents
                            different areas of expertise. This will ensure that your needs are met
                            with the various modalities and that your visit is productive.
