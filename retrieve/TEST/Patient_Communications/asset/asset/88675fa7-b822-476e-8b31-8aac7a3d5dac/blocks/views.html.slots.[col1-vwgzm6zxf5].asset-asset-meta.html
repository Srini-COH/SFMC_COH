                                    to determine the diagnostic testing needed to confirm the
                                    results noted in your medical records. These tests, and any
                                    additional appointments with specialists, will be conducted
                                    throughout your visit. This information will help your care team
                                    develop a treatment plan personalized to your individual cancer
                                    type and needs.

                                    discuss treatment options. During this discussion, you will have
                                    the opportunity to ask any questions you may have about your
                                    options so that you can choose the treatment plan that works
                                    best for you. At this time, you can also decide when you want to
                                    begin treatment.
