                            review your medical history. This call typically takes about 30 minutes
                            and should already be scheduled. During this call you will have an
                            opportunity to ask any questions you may have about your upcoming visit.
                            Throughout your stay with us, your nurse navigator will check in on you
                            periodically to see how you are doing and answer any questions. If your

                            your nurse navigator and all other information. This will ensure that we

                            evaluation plan and answer any questions you may have.

                            Insurance policies can be complex, and your insurance company&rsquo;s

                            appointment, we encourage you to meet with a Financial Counselor. He/she
                            will be glad to go over the coverage your insurance has communicated to
                            us in more detail and to assist you with any financial questions you may
                            have concerning medical services you receive. Our Financial Counselors
