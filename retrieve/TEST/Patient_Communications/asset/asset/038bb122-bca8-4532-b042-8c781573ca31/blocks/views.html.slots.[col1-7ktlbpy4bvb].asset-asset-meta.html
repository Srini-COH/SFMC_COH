                                    appointments with specialists, will be conducted throughout your
                                    visit. This information will help your care team develop a

                                    discuss treatment options. During this discussion, you will have
                                    the opportunity to ask any questions you may have about your
                                    options so that you can choose the treatment plan that works
                                    best for you. At this time, you can also decide when you want to
