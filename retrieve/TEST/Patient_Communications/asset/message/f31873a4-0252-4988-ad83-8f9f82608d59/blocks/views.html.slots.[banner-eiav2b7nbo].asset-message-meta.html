            The holiday season can be a time of great joy and great stress. There are gifts to buy,
            cookies to bake, parties to attend and family gatherings to host. But everyone has their
            limit and sometimes, it&rsquo;s all just too much &mdash; especially if you're a cancer
            patient or caregiver who already has too much on your plate.
