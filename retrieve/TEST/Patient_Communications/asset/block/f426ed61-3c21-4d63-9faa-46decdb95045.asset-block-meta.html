                <br />Many organizations offer information and assistance to people living with
                cancer, but it's sometimes hard to know what resources can offer reliable and
                trustworthy support. Here is a list of excellent resources that can help you find
                information about cancer, treatment options, support groups in your community and
                financial and legal services. I encourage you to reach out to these organizations to
                learn how they can help you in your cancer journey.
