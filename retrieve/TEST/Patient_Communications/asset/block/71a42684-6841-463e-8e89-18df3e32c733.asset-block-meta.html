                <br />My friend, I understand this is a complex topic. To help, I am linking to more
                information about the promise of precision cancer treatment, genomic testing and the
                benefits precision cancer treatment can offer. Whether precision cancer treatment is
                right for you is a decision you make with your medical team based on your individual
                situation. However, at CTCA&reg;, we believe that the more information you have, the
                better informed decisions you can make about your own cancer treatment.
