                One important factor to keep in mind as you proceed with your cancer treatment is
                the overall treatment results of the cancer center where you are receiving
                treatment. Clear and thorough information on survival, quality-of-life and patient
                satisfaction results can help you determine which provider may be best suited to
                treat your type of cancer.
