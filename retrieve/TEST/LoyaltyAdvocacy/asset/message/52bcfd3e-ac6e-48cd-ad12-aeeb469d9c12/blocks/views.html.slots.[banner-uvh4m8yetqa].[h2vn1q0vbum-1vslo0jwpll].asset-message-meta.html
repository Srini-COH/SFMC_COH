                        the CEOT. Previously, I had worked in oncology clinical research for nine
                        years, developing and implementing a cancer research program across a
                        seven-hospital system. Additionally, I spent four years in physician
                        relations and business development in a health care environment.&nbsp;</span

                        graduated recently with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree and is considering
                        graduate schools while working in her field. My son attended community
                        college for two years and is transferring to a university in fall of 2020.
                        &nbsp;We love to travel and explore together.</span

                        foster family for a local animal shelter for nearly 10 years. We care for
                        litters of kittens, and sometimes puppies, until they are old enough to
                        become available for adoption. We have also served as volunteer ambassadors
                        for <i>The Good Mourning Program for Children, Teens and Families</i>, a
                        bereavement support program for children and their families.</span

                        Whether it&rsquo;s a small craft or refinishing our deck, I love to roll up
                        my sleeves and dive right in. For me, there is great satisfaction in a job
                        well done.&nbsp;</span
