                During these uncertain times, we have all been finding comfort in different ways,
                from completing puzzles and preparing home-cooked meals to finding new ways to
                connect with family and friends. Of course, there are many ways to connect
                electronically, but there is one simple way to brighten anyone's spirit&nbsp;&mdash;
                a handwritten card or letter!<br />
                <br />
                You may remember that Cancer Fighters<sup>&reg;</sup> offered a set of HOPE cards in
                March 2020. This exclusive set included five colorful cards, each with a unique
                uplifting message. We encouraged members to &quot;make someone smile with these
                messages of hope, support and inspirations&quot;, but little did we know just how
                much support and inspiration would be needed in the months to come.<br />
                <br />
                In an effort to continue spreading kindness and inspiration during this time, Cancer
                Fighters is pleased to again offer this HOPE card set to you!
