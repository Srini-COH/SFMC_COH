Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
Over the last few months, Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) Tulsa has signed several in-network contract agreements, providing cancer care access to more local and national individuals and families. In December 2019, CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup> Tulsa became an in-network provider for the Oklahoma State Medical Association (OSMA) and in January became an in-network provider with Evolution and Connect Health Benefits.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
And, we are excited to announce that as of February 1, CTCA Tulsa is now an in-network provider with Aetna! These in-network contracts, as well as those already in place with Cigna and HealthChoice, allow CTCA to expand its footprint of in-network care delivery to more patients and families in need of expert cancer care.<br>
<br>

<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Your Cancer Fighters Team</td></tr></table>
