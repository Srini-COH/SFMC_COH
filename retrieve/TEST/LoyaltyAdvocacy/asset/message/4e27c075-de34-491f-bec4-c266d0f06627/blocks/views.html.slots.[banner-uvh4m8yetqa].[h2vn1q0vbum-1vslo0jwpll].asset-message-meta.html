                            ><b>PROFESSIONAL:</b> I have been a member of the CTCA family since
                            2011. My first position was working with the physicians and clinical
                            staff at CTCA Chicago, investigating new technologies and tools for
                            patient care. During the past five years, I have been an Oncology
                            Information Specialist (OIS), dedicated to helping people diagnosed with
                            cancer gain access to treatment at one of our comprehensive cancer care
                            centers. I have spoken with over 60,000 cancer patients and family
                            members, and I strive to understand what is unique and important to each
                            caller.&nbsp;<br />

                            <b>PERSONAL:</b> &nbsp;I am the father of two boys, ages 14 and 18. My
                            family and I love the outdoors. During spring, summer and fall, we spend
                            our free time biking, fishing, at sporting events, enjoying music and
                            eating our meals outside. In winter, we&rsquo;re active in snowboarding.
                            Both of my sons are involved with a variety of sports, so whatever is
                            happening at the time, I get involved.&nbsp;<br />
                            <br />
                            <b>VOLUNTEER WORK:</b> &nbsp;Most of my time is dedicated to my two
                            sons&rsquo; sports activities. I am often teased about being the
                            official &ldquo;team dad&rdquo;. I have coached Little League Baseball
                            for many years and served as assistant coach for my sons&rsquo; soccer
                            and basketball teams.</span
