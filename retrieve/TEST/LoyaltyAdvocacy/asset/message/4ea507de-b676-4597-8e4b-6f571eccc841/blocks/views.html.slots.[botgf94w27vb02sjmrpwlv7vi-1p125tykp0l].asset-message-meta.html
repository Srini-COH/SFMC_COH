            November is lung cancer awareness month. Lung cancer is currently the leading cause of
            cancer death among both men and women.<br />
            <br />
            According the American Cancer Society, lung cancer makes up almost 25% of all cancer
            deaths, killing more people than colon, breast and prostate cancers combined.<br />
            <br />
            We hope you will join us in spreading the word about the importance of prevention,
            screenings and early detection for lung cancer. Consider creating awareness with your
            employees by sharing these important resources.<br />
