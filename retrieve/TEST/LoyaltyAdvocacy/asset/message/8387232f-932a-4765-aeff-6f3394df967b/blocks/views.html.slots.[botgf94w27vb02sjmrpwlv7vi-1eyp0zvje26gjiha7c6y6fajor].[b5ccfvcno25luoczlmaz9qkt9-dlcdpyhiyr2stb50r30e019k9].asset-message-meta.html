Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
At this time of heightened awareness around the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), our top priority is the health and safety of our patients. Because many of our patients travel to Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) for care, we understand the uncertainty and concern around current travel risks, especially among many of our patients who may be at higher risk of susceptibility for certain diseases due to compromised immune function.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We are doing everything in our power to ensure the safety of all patients, staff and visitors, and we are working closely with local and national health authorities to stay informed on all important developments.<br>
<br>
We have implemented CDC-recommended screening protocols and readiness plans at each of our hospitals and Outpatient Care Centers. As an added measure, our facilities are currently conducting additional screening protocol for all patients and visitors. We are closely monitoring CDC travel recommendations and guidelines and are continuously educating and training our care providers as developments occur. Out of an abundance of caution, we are asking that patients be accompanied by only a single caregiver over the age of 18.<br>
<br>
For your safety, we advise that you limit unnecessary travel and avoid large crowds. In many cases, travel by car may be advised in order to avoid delays in treatment. Those patients planning to travel are urged to stay informed of current <a alias="CDC travel guidelines" conversion="false" data-linkto="https://" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html" style="color:#007FA3;text-decoration:underline;" title="CDC travel guidelines">CDC travel guidelines</a> as well as monitor travel updates from the federal government and the airlines.<br>
<br>
If you have questions about an upcoming appointment or would like to discuss travel related to your own health situation, please contact your CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup> clinical team directly. Please be aware that we are currently fielding a very high volume of calls. If you have non-urgent inquiries, please wait to call at a later date so that patients with immediate needs can access their care teams quickly.
