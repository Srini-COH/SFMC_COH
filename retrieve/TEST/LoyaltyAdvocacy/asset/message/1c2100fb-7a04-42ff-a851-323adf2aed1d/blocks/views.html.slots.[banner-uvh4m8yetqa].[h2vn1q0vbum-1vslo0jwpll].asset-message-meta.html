                ><b>PROFESSIONAL</b>: I have worked for CTCA for over five years, helping patients
                and caregivers who call by answering their questions about cancer care at CTCA and,
                if appropriate, arranging for an evaluation at one of our Comprehensive Care and
                Research Centers. It is inspiring to be able to help people during one of the most
                challenging periods of their lives.<br />
                <br />
                <b>PERSONAL</b>: &nbsp;I have been married to my high school sweetheart, Amy, for 26
                years. We have a son, Justin, age 21, who is pursuing a career in music as a sound
                engineer in Nashville, Tennessee. We are &ldquo;empty nesters,&rdquo; except for our
                two Shih Tzu dogs, Snickers and Baci.<br />
                <br />
                <b>HOBBIES</b>: I have lived in Chicagoland my entire life and enjoy our change in
                seasons as well as sporting events. I am a big fan of the Chicago Bears, White Sox
                and Bulls! I also enjoy reading, exercising and spending time with family, friends
                and my church community. I volunteer as a youth leader and have also served on three
                mission trips outside of the U.S., including Mexico and the Dominican
                Republic.</span
