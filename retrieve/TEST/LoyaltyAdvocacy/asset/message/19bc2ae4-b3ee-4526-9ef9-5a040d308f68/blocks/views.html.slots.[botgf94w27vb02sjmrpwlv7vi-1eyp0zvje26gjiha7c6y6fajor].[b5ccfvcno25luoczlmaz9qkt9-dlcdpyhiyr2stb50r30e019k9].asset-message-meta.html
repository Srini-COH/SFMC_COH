Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
We have wonderful news to share! Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA), Chicago is pleased to announce that as of March 15, 2020 we are an in-network provider with Aetna. This new agreement, along with our existing relationships, allows CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup> Chicago and both Illinois Outpatient Care Centers located in downtown Chicago and Gurnee, Illinois to expand its footprint of in-network care delivery for more patients and families in need of expert cancer care.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Patients want and deserve choice and options in health care, and certainly when making decisions about cancer care,&rdquo; said Pete Govorchin, President and CEO, CTCA Chicago. &ldquo;The addition of Aetna as a contracted insurance provider will allow Aetna enrollees access to the high-quality clinical care and patient empowerment that are the very hallmarks of CTCA.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This latest agreement with Aetna adds to contracts already in place at CTCA Chicago and allows CTCA to expand its footprint of in-network care delivery to patients and families in need of expert cancer care. The in-network options offered through Aetna include, but are not limited to: HMO, PPO, EPO, POS, QPOS, Elect Choice, Open Choice, Managed Choice POS, Aetna Choice POS II, Aetna Select, Aetna Student Health, indemnity plans with network incentives, Aetna Signature Administrators&reg;, Joint Claims Administration, Meritain/Meritain Shared Administrative Services, Passport to Healthcare&reg; and National Advantage Program.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
