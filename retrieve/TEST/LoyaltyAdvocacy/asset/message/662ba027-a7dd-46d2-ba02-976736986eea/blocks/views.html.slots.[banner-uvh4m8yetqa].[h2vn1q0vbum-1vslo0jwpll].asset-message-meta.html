                            is what drives me to help others lead healthy lifestyles through
                            individualized care practices. I earned my Master&rsquo;s in Healthcare
                            Administration with a specialization in strategic and innovative change
                            along with a Bachelors in Kinesiology (the study of body movement). I
                            have over nine years of health care experience, most recently, as
                            Program Manager of Neurology (academic) and seven years as Manager of
                            Wellness Services for a senior living center. I joined CTCA because,
                            when my own family was affected by cancer, I was inspired by the
                            compassion of their caregivers. I want to &ldquo;give back&rdquo; to
                            people in the cancer community just as others have done for my
                            family.</span

                            and love any type of fitness. I have the sweetest English Bulldog, named
                            Benjamin, who likes to join me on kayak rides in the spring and
                            summer.</span

                            cancer centers and senior living centers. I hope to work with the

                            <b>HOBBIES</b>: &nbsp;You could almost say I grew up in a gymnastics
                            gym, so I love any activity that keeps me moving. In my free time I
                            enjoy soccer, tennis, yoga, &nbsp;powerlifting, Olympic-style weight
                            lifting, biking and hiking.</span
