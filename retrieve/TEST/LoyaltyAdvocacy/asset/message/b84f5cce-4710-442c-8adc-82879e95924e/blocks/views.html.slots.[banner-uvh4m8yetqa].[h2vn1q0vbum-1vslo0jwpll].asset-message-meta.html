                            ><b>PROFESSIONAL:</b> I have worked at CTCA for 30 years. I started in
                            human resources just about 3 months after the Tulsa center opened in
                            1990. I transitioned over to speaking with patients in 1992. Helping
                            others gives me great joy and I feel honored and blessed to help so many
                            find the care they so deserve.<br />

                            <b>PERSONAL:</b> &nbsp;I am married to my husband, Karl, of 30 years. We
                            have two grown children, a daughter and son, both in the Air Force. Our
                            daughter is also married to a Submariner with the Navy and they have two
                            boys, ages 7 and 5. Our son is single. I love being a grandmother and
                            take every chance I get to go visit them.<br />

                            <b>VOLUNTEER WORK:</b> &nbsp;I am a member of the Assistance in
                            Healthcare, Inc. Tulsa branch. This organization assists patients
                            financially who are receiving cancer treatment in the Tulsa area for
                            things like food, childcare, gas, housing, etc. I am also a member of
                            the Hope Works volunteer group at CTCA.<br />

                            <b>HOBBIES</b>: My husband and I are avid motorcyclists and we like to
                            go on long trips. So far, the only state in the lower 48 not visited by
                            motorcycle is Oregon. We have also traveled to many of the Canadian
                            providences. We love to waterski and snow ski/snowboard and do our best
                            to fit in these activities, too. The best times are when we coordinate
                            the family time with the activities.</span
