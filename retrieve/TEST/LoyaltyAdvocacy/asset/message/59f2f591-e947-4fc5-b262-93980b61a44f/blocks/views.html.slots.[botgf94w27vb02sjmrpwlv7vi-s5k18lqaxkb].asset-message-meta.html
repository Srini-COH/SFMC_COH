                ><b>City of Hope Physicians Collaborating Through Joint Tumor Boards</b><br />
                Currently, patient cases are being presented at joint tumor boards, where our
                experts provide education and insights on complex cases to provide the best care
                across all locations. This type of collaboration has enormous benefits for patients
                as it allows for partnership across the City of Hope national system.<br />
                <br />
                For instance,&nbsp;City of Hope Chicago reached out to subspecialists at City of
                Hope Los Angeles regarding a rare genomic alteration for non-small lung cancer in
                the EGFR gene. Based on experience with this cancer and its treatment, City of Hope
                Los Angeles doctors knew it would have a limited effect and shared insights about an
                alternative course of treatment based on research conducted at City of Hope.</span
