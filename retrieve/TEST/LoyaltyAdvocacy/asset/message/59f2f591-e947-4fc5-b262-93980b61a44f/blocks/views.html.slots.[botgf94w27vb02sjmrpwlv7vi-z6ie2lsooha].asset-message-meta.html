                Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) is now City of
                Hope<sup>&reg;</sup>, uniting our shared vision, values and commitment to
                high-quality, compassionate care that puts patients first. We've achieved a number
                of milestones with the integration of CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup>, including CTCA locations
                now functioning as nonprofit organizations, the ongoing implementation of City of
                Hope clinical and quality policies, and joint quality reviews and tumor boards to
                integrate findings and insight on complex cases encouraging the best care across all
                locations. City of Hope has also brought its world-renowned expertise in bone marrow
                and blood stem cell transplants and CAR-T cell therapy to the Phoenix and Chicago
                locations.<br />
                <br />
                Now, as part of this ongoing transformation, we've reached another important
                milestone &mdash; the rebranding of CTCA locations to City of Hope Atlanta, City of
                Hope Chicago and City of Hope Phoenix.<br />
                <br />
                As we maximize the reach and expertise of our national system, we are committed to
                keeping you up to date on the important progress taking place at City of Hope.</span
