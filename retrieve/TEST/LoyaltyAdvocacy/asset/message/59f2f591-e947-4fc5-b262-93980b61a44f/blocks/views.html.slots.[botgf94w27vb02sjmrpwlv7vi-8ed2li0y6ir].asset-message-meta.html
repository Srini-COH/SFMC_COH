                ><b>Patient Who Achieved HIV Remission Shares His Story</b><br />
                In July 2022, City of Hope announced that a 66-year-old man who had been
                HIV-positive for more than 30 years had gone into remission for acute myeloid
                leukemia and HIV thanks to a transplant using stem cells from a donor with a rare
                genetic mutation, homozygous CCR5 Delta 32. The mutation makes people who carry it
                resistant to acquiring HIV.<br />
                <br />
                Of the five people in the world who have achieved remission for both diseases after
                receiving a transplant with the rare mutation, the man was the oldest in the group
                and the person who had HIV the longest.<br />
                <br />
                At the time, the patient wished to remain anonymous. But now he is openly telling
                his story.&nbsp;<a
