Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
The Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) Mind-Body Medicine team invites you to join a virtual Breast Cancer Support Group. Led by Behavioral Health Therapist Diane Schaab, the Breast Cancer Support Group will provide emotional and social support to people with breast cancer, as well as a forum to give and receive support in a safe environment.<br>
<br>
Sessions for this&nbsp;<u>closed</u>&nbsp;support group will last six weeks and will be held weekly beginning on Wednesday, August 26 through Wednesday, September 30. We ask that you commit to the entire duration of this support group so the same participants have the opportunity to experience this journey together.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
