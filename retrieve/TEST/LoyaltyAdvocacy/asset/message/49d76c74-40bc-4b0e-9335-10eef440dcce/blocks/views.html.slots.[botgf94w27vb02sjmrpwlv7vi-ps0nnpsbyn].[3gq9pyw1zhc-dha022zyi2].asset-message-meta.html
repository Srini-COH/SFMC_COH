                    >Diane began her career working as a teacher. However, her strong desire to help
                    others led her to volunteer her time at CTCA Chicago. Having lost a family
                    member to cancer, Schaab felt a strong connection to working with patients and
                    caregivers.<br />
                    <br />
                    At CTCA Atlanta, Schaab leads individual and group counseling sessions, runs
                    support groups, and conduct relaxation and guided imagery sessions.</span
