Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
World Lung Cancer Day, observed annually on August 1, provides an opportunity to raise awareness of the risk factors for lung cancer and to offer solutions for how to prevent lung cancer, ensure early detection and improve patient outcomes and quality of life.<br>
<br>
You inspire us each and every day. And, we're hoping you are willing to share that inspiration with others this World Lung Cancer Day.&nbsp;We are reaching out to ask for you to share your story of inspiration, hope and encouragement. Your Cancer Fighters<sup>&reg;</sup> team will share your submissions with the Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) lung cancer care teams as well as on the CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup> social media platforms in an effort to bring awareness to lung cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
