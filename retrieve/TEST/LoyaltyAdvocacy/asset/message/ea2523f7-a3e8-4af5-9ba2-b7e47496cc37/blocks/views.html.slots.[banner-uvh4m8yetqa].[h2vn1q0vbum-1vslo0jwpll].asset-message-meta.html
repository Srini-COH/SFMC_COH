                ><b>PROFESSIONAL</b>: I joined CTCA as a member of CEOT in 2020. It is an honor to
                be part of a team that is dedicated to making a real and lasting difference in the
                lives of the people we serve.<br />
                <br />
                <b>PERSONAL:&nbsp;</b>I live in Chicago and enjoy the great experiences and variety
                of foods the city has to offer. I am committed to helping cancer patients because my
                mom and several of my aunts are cancer survivors. Walking alongside them during
                their journeys has inspired me to strive to help others during this difficult time
                in their lives.<br />
                <br />
                <b>VOLUNTEERING:</b>&nbsp;I have worked as a volunteer for the American Cancer
                Society (ACS) since 2011. As an ACS volunteer, I participate in a variety of
                community and distinguished events designed to raise money and awareness for the
                support services and research that ACS provides and funds on behalf of cancer
                patients and their families.<br />
                <br />
                <b>HOBBIES:</b>&nbsp;I love to spend quality time with my boyfriend, our dog,
                friends and family. I have run 14 marathons and enjoy casual bike rides. Some of my
                other hobbies include travel, cooking and baking.</span
