Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
We have some excited news to share! &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Your Cancer Fighters<sup>&reg;</sup> team understands the importance of connections. We know how powerful it is to meet and talk with other patients and caregivers, especially if you have something in common. Helping our members make these connections is at the heart of what we do.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We are so excited to share with you that we are hosting a monthly virtual Zoom meeting with Cancer Fighters members that are from the Detroit area. During these meetings you will be able to meet and connect with other Cancer Fighters that live nearby. Plus, you will learn more about the Cancer Fighters program and other Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;(CTCA) resources, including special educational and fun events designed with our Detroit area Cancer Fighters in mind.<br>
<br>
For this group to be successful, we need Cancer Fighters like you to join the meeting.<br>
