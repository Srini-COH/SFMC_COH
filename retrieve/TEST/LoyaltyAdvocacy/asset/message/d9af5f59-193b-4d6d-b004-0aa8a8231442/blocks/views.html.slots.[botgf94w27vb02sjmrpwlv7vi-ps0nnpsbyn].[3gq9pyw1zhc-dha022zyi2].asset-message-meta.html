                    address any sexual concerns related to various medical diagnoses, cancer
                    treatments and menopause. She advises couples on opportunities to stay connected
                    during times of challenge and provides emotional support throughout their care

                    information regarding intimacy and pleasure,&rdquo; says Owen. &ldquo;My
                    ultimate goal for patients is that they will feel equipped, encouraged and
                    empowered to pursue the intimate relationship they want to share with their
                    partner.&rdquo;</span
