                ><b>PROFESSIONAL</b>: I have worked for CTCA for 10 years. I have been involved in
                many different pilots and new initiatives. From helping to pioneer our video
                engagement team, to working on cancer specific and hospital specific teams, putting
                the patient first has always been my top priority. &nbsp;Working at CTCA has taught
                me so much on what it means to deliver compassionate care.<br />
                <br />
                <b>PERSONAL:&nbsp;</b>My wife Melissa and I met at the University of Iowa back in
                2003. We had a destination wedding in Mexico in 2009. &nbsp;Currently we live out in
                Geneva, IL with our 8-year-old son Jaxson and 5-year-old daughter Jules. &nbsp;<br />
                <br />
                <b>VOLUNTEERING:</b>&nbsp;I volunteer at my son and daughter&rsquo;s school and I
                help coach their athletic teams. I also helped organize a community effort to buy
                school supplies for local families in need. &nbsp;<br />
                <br />
                <b>HOBBIES:</b>&nbsp;In my free time, I&rsquo;m cheering on my kids at all their
                different activities. We&rsquo;re traveling as a family and exploring new places. My
                wife and I love spending a peaceful night out with friends and family. I also love
                to golf and do any fun activity outside on a beautiful day. &nbsp;</span
