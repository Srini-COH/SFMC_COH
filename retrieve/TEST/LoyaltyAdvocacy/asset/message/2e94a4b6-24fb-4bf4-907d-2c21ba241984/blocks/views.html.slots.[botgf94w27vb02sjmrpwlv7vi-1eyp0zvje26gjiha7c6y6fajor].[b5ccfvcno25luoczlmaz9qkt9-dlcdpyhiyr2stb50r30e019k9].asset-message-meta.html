Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
We know it&rsquo;s true; cancer can affect us at any age. According to the American Cancer Society<sup>&reg;</sup>, there are 80,000 Americans between the ages of 20-39 diagnosed with cancer every year&mdash;about 5% of all cancers diagnosed. A cancer diagnosis at any age is difficult, but a diagnosis for young adults adds a host of different issues and concerns. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Here at Cancer Fighters<sup>&reg;</sup> and Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA), we want to help provide connection for this unique community.<br>

It's a great resource for information and allows other Cancer Fighters like yourself a chance to connect online.<br>
<br>
In addition to the online community, we're looking to host virtual events for Young Fighters. Would you consider participating? Please take a minute to <a alias="complete our survey" conversion="false" data-linkto="http://" href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SZX5PQ8" style="color:#1010ee;text-decoration:underline;" title="complete our survey">complete our survey</a> to tell us when would be best for you to join. We'll follow up with details of a Zoom session once we learn when it's convenient for the majority interested in attending.<br>
<br>
We hope that this will be a great first step to build connections, support and learn more about each other. We'd love to have your feedback about the best times for you so we can move forward with scheduling a get-together.<br>

Sincerely,<br>
