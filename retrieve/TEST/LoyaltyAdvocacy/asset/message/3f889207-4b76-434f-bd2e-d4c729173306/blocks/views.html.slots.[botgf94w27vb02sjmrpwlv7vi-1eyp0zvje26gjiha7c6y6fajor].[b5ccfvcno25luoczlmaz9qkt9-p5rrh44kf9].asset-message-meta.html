Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
The Celebrate Life<sup>&reg;</sup> Survivor Tree has a new look and enhanced experience in each Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) location! Now, in addition to its availability on CancerFighters.com, the Survivor Tree at CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup> Atlanta, CTCA Chicago and CTCA Phoenix are now accessible for you to engage with as part of your hospital visit.<br>
<br>
The Survivor Tree is a longstanding embodiment of strength, perseverance and hope at CTCA. Throughout the years, a personal leaf has been added to the tree for each patient reaching his or her five-year milestone and, over time, countless leaves formed a tapestry of personal stories and journeys.<br>
<br>
During your next visit, be sure to stop by and tour the new tree! You can look for your leaf, explore stories from others with the same cancer type as you or simply browse to see the inspiring stories collected over the years.</td></tr></table>
