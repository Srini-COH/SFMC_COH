										<br>
										A few weeks ago, we told you that current state law restricts Cancer Treatment Centers of America&reg; (CTCA) in Newnan to seeing just 35% of its patients from Georgia and caps our hospital at 50 beds. We worked diligently in both the House and Senate to address this issue by removing these restrictions and allowing CTCA&reg; to operate as a General Hospital focused solely on adult cancer care under the same Certificate of Need rules that govern other hospitals...<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										On Friday, after years of passionate and tireless effort by so many, we earned an incredible victory for Georgia cancer patients and for patient choice!&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										House Bill 186 passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 170 to 3, <u>marking the first major change in a decade to Georgia's certificate of need laws</u>.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The bill will move to Governor Kemp to sign into law, thereby eliminating our restrictions (Georgia patient cap and bed cap) and giving more Georgians access to the cancer care they want and need.&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										We want to thank YOU for all of the work you have done over the years to make this possible! You sent in your thoughts on the importance of patient choice, contacted your legislators, spread the word on social media and worked right alongside the CTCA Government Affairs team every step of the way.&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Thank YOU for your dedication to this change in allowing Georgia patients to have a choice in their own cancer care.&nbsp; This is an incredible milestone that will bring such a positive change to cancer care in Georgia.&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Stayed tuned for more information on celebrating this milestone together!<br>
