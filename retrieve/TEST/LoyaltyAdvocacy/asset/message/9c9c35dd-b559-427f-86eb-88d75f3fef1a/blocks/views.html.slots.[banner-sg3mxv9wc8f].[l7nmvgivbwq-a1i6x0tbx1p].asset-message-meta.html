                >Kathleen loves to travel and explore the world with her two adult children. She's
                passionate about DIY projects and finds great satisfaction in a job well done. From
                small crafts to overhauling a deck, she loves to roll up her sleeves and dive in to
                make something with her own two hands.<br />

                In her spare time, she volunteers with a local animal shelter as a foster mom to
                help raise kittens and puppies until they are old enough to be adopted into forever
                homes.</span
