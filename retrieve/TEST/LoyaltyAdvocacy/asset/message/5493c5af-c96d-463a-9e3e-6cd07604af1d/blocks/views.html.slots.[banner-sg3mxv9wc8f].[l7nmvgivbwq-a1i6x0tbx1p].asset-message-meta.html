                >Jane loves the great outdoors. She, along with her husband and son, can often be
                found playing outside, visiting the zoo, swinging at a local park or going for long
                walks.<br />
                <br />
                And while she has hiked through her fair share of national parks, she's an outdoorsy
                person who also enjoys creature comforts like hotels&mdash;no camping for her!<br />
                <br />
                In her spare time, she enjoys getting involved with her local food bank.</span
