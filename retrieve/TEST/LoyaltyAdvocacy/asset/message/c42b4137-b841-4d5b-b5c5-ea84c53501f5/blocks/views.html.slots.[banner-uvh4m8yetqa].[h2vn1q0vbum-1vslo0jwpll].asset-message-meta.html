                            <b>PROFESSIONAL:</b> I'm very grateful to be a new member of this
                            passionate team. Previously, I worked in behavioral health with a focus
                            on pediatric autism. I partnered with pediatricians&nbsp;and specialists
                            to identify symptoms early and have up-to-date knowledge on all
                            available treatment&nbsp;options. I am privileged to continue to listen
                            and support patients and their families to help meet their needs and
                            support them through their journey.<br />
                            <br />
                            <b>PERSONAL: </b>I have a 21-year daughter. We are very close and love
                            to attend Broadway performances together. I have a beautiful sister, a
                            survivor of Peritoneal cancer and also a patient at CTCA since 2015. We
                            live a mile apart from one another and I am very involved as her
                            caregiver. This work is my honor. I engage in it mind, body and
                            spirit.<br />
                            <br />
                            <b>VOLUNTEERING:</b> I am a volunteer for an organization called
                            Imerman's Angels. This organization allows me to support other
                            caregivers, as I was, and listen to and support them through their own
                            experience managing this difficult time.<br />
                            <br />
                            <b>HOBBIES:</b> I am a 3 dog household! I love biking, skiing,
                            rollerblading, theater and travel. I have no green thumb whatsoever, but
                            I make a mean loaf of bread.<br /> </span></span></span
