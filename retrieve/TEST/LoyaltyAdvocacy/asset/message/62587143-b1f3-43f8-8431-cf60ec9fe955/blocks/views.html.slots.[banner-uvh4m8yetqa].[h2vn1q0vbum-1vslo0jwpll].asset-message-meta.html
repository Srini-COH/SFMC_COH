                ><b>PROFESSIONAL:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I joined CTCA&reg; in 2019 as a member of the
                CEOT. Previously, I had worked in oncology clinical research for nine years,
                developing and implementing a cancer research program across a seven-hospital
                system. Additionally, I spent four years in physician relations and business
                development in a health care environment.&nbsp;<br />
                <br />
                <b>PERSONAL:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two college-aged children. My daughter graduated
                recently with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree and is considering graduate schools while
                working in her field. My son attended community college for two years and is
                transferring to a university in fall of 2020. &nbsp;We love to travel and explore
                together.<br />
                <br />
                <b>VOLUNTEERING:</b>&nbsp; My children and I have been volunteering as a foster
                family for a local animal shelter for nearly 10 years. We care for litters of
                kittens, and sometimes puppies, until they are old enough to become available for
                adoption. We have also served as volunteer ambassadors for
                <i>The Good Mourning Program for Children, Teens and Families</i>, a bereavement
                support program for children and their families.<br />
                <br />
                <b>HOBBIES:</b>&nbsp; I really enjoy DIY (do-it-yourself) projects!&nbsp; Whether
                it&rsquo;s a small craft or refinishing our deck, I love to roll up my sleeves and
                dive right in. For me, there is great satisfaction in a job well done.&nbsp;</span
