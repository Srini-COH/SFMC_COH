            Hi %%FirstName%%,<br />
            <br />
            Happy December! We hope this email finds you well.<br />
            <br />
            The holidays are a time to feast with family and friends, travel to see the folks and
            shop for that special gift. This year, while the risk of infection from COVID-19 is
            still a factor, many people may be able to rekindle their holiday traditions.<br />
            <br />
            Navigating a safe holiday season is important, and this month's newsletter features tips
            from Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) experts. Be sure to
            share this with your colleagues and enjoy the holidays!<br />
