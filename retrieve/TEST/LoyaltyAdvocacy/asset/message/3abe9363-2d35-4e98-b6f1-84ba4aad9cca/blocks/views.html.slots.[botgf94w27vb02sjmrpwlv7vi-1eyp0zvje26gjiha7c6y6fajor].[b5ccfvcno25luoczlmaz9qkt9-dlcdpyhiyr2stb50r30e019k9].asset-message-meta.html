                Coping with cancer treatment burnout
            </h1>
            <br />
            Patients struggling with treatment burnout often encounter waves of emotion and
            uncertainty about their future. They endure emotionally and physically exhausting
            treatments, often with doubts about their results. Some may have their independence
            stripped away, or they may feel they are a burden to others. Many ponder the common
            question: &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo;
