                Hi %%FirstName%%,<br />
                <br />
                September brings the start of fall and several nationally recognized health
                observances that aim to spread awareness about gynecologic, prostate and blood
                cancers. In this month's newsletter, you'll find information to help you and your
                employees learn more about these cancers types, their risk factors, screening
                guidelines and more.
            </p>
