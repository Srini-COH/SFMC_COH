Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
Join fellow Cancer Fighters<sup>&reg;</sup> as member Karla Baptiste shows us how to begin the process of gratitude journaling and shares how it helped her navigate through her cancer journey.<br>
<br>
Taking a few minutes every day to acknowledge the things that you are grateful for can lead to a happier mindset.<br>
<br>
Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned journaling pro, all skill levels are welcome to attend this virtual event on Tuesday, November 16 at 2 p.m. ET.</td></tr></table>
