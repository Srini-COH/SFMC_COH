                Hydration &mdash; Drink for Your Health
            </h1>
            <br />
            &ldquo;Water is the driving force of all nature,&rdquo; Leonardo da Vinci once said.
            Earth is 70 percent water; our bodies are 60 percent. And just as water gives life to
            our planet, it is a driving life force in the human body. &nbsp;Water transports
            nutrients and oxygen, protects our organs and lubricates our joints. It also helps
            regulate heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature.<br />
            <br />
            As important as it is to stay hydrated when you&rsquo;re well, studies show it&rsquo;s
            essential during cancer treatment. &ldquo;Good hydration helps flush toxins out of the
            body and reduce treatment side effects, such as nausea, weakness, constipation and
            fatigue,&rdquo; says Melissa Picchietti, RD, LDN, a Clinical Oncology Dietitian at
            Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) in Chicago.
