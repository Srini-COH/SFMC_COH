Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
If you know her, you know just how special Traci Owen is to Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;(CTCA) in Tulsa. We are excited to announce that Traci recently received her certification as a Sexual Counselor by the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT). Traci is the only Certified Sexuality Counselor (CSC) in the state of Oklahoma, as well as the surrounding states of Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas and Arizona!<br>
<br>
Traci works with both male and female patients to address changes in intimate relationships, body image and confidence, along with a wide variety of concerns that arise during cancer treatment. She also guides couples to achieve the level of intimacy they desire to share. The sexual health and intimacy program at CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup> Tulsa is now available to all patients -- even those not treating at CTCA. As a benefit of being a CTCA Tulsa patient, you can take advantage of this program at no charge.<br>
<br>
For more information on how to schedule an appointment with Traci, please contact <a href="tel:9182865900">918-286-5900</a>.<br>
