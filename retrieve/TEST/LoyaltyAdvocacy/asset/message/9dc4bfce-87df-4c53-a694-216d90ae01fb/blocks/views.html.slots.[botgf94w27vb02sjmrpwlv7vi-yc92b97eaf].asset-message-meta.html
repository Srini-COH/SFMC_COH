                Hi %%FirstName%%,<br />
                <br />
                An estimated 287,850 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in U.S. women in
                2022, according to the American Cancer Society. However, advances in treatment mean
                many women today could expect to beat the disease. Early detection is key, so during
                Breast Cancer Awareness Month we're sharing resources to help you and your employees
                understand when and how often to get screened, ways you can help lower your risk and
                more.
