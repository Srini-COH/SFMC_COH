Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
It's time to make movement fun! Walk, bike or run with us on Saturday, October 17 for the first Cancer Fighters Virtual Movement Challenge!<br>
<br>
<b>While we might be physically apart right now, no one walks through cancer alone</b>. Come together virtually with Cancer Fighters from all over the country as we celebrate moving our bodies while spreading the hope and camaraderie of the Cancer Fighters community with each and every step! We invite you to join us from your own space, whether it be your local park, neighborhood or even your treadmill at home, to walk, bike or run the distance of your choice, from a 5k to a mile or even just a stroll down the street!<br>
