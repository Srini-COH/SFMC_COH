	The West Valley Heart Walk has always been a great way to get moving while socializing with friends, family and co-workers leading up to and on the day of event. But it's so much more than a walk. Walking in the Heart Walk boosts your heart health AND mental health while helping millions of others at the same time.<br>

	Be a supporter of critical research. Be a community energizer. Be a champion. Be a lifesaver. You are all of these things because you are a walker.</div></td></tr></table>
