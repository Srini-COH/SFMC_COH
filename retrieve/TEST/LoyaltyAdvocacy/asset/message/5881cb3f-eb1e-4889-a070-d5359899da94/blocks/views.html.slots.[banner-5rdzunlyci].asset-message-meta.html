										<br>
										As you may already know, current state law restricts Georgians from choosing Cancer Treatment Centers of America&reg; (CTCA) for cancer care because we were defined by law in 2008 as a &quot;destination cancer hospital,&rdquo; restricted to 50 beds, and only allowed to see 35% of our patients from Georgia. We currently have legislation both in the Senate and the House that contains language to address this issue by removing those restrictions and allowing CTCA&reg; to operate as a General Hospital focused solely on adult cancer care under the same Certificate of Need rules that govern other hospitals.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Your Senator, Jack Hill, is on the Senate Regulated Industries &amp; Utilities Committee. This committee will ultimately decide whether Senate Bill 74 will make it through to the Senate and House floors for a vote. The hearing for Senate Bill 74 will be Thursday, February 21, so we're trying to act quickly.&nbsp; Would you be willing to reach out to Senator Hill at </font>404-657-7094 or <a alias="jack.hill@senate.ga.gov" conversion="false" data-linkto="mailto:" href="mailto:jack.hill@senate.ga.gov?subject=" style="color:#808080;text-decoration:underline;" title="jack.hill@senate.ga.gov">jack.hill@senate.ga.gov</a><font color="#000000">?&nbsp;<br>

										If you are more comfortable emailing him, I have a sample message below to help get you started. But you are certainly welcome and encouraged to personalize the email!&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">We also invite you to attend the hearing with us at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday at the Capitol. If you are interested in attending,&nbsp;<a alias="please let me" conversion="false" data-linkto="mailto:" href="mailto:cfatlanta@ctca-hope.com?subject=" style="" title="please let me">please let me</a>&nbsp;know and I will send you the details!</span></b><br>

										<i>Senator Hill,<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										I urge you to support SB 74. Here's why (share personal piece of your story/your reason for advocacy).&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										All Georgians should have the right to choose where they receive their cancer care. Isn't that what you would want if you or one of your loved ones was diagnosed with cancer?<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										As your constituent, I would appreciate your support on this issue.</i><br>
										<br>
										Sincerely,<br>
										Your Cancer Fighters Team<br>
