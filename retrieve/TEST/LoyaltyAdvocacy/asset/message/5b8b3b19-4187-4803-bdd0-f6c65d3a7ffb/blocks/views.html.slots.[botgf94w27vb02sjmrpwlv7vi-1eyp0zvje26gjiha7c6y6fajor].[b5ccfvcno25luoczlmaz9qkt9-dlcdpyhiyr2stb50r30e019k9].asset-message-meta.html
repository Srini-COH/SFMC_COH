Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
In recognition of breast cancer awareness month,&nbsp;Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) Atlanta invites you and your loved ones to schedule an appointment for your next 3-D breast cancer screening. These screenings are available to adults, including patients, caregivers and the local community.<br>
<br>
The screening and diagnostic program offers quick appointments, rapid results and access to specialists. CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup> accepts most insurance plans, and screenings are only $99 for those without insurance.<br>
<br>
94% of breast cancer related appointments have been delayed or cancelled due to COVID-19. However, studies show that regular screenings are the most reliable way to find and treat breast cancer early. To schedule a 3-D breast cancer screening at CTCA Atlanta, please call <a href="tel:1-770-400-6677">770-400-6677</a>.<br>
