Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
	<br>
	Join us for an inspirational series with Dr. Renee Alsarraf, veterinary oncologist, cancer survivor and author of <i>Sit, Stay, Heal: What Dogs Can Teach us About Living Well.</i><br>
	<br>
	In this two-part series, Dr. Alsarraf&nbsp;will share her journey of how she went from treating animals with cancer to being a cancer patient herself, and all the life lessons she learned along the way.&nbsp;<br>
