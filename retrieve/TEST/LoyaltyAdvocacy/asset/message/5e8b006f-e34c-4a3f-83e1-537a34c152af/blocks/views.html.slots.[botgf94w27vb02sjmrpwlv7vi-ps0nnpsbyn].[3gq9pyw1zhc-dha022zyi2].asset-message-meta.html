                        >Dr. Alsikafi serves patients who have prostate, bladder, kidney or
                        testicular cancer. He consults with medical oncologists and patients on
                        available treatment options, performs surgery and monitors patients who many
                        need surgical intervention in the future.<br />

                        Inspired to become a doctor because of his desire to help people, Dr.
                        Alsikafi says, &quot;My father was a physician who was an excellent role
                        model. I chose urology specifically because it was a beautiful blend of
                        surgery and medical management. It also dealt with sensitive topics, which I
                        felt my personality was well suited to discuss with patients.&quot;</span
