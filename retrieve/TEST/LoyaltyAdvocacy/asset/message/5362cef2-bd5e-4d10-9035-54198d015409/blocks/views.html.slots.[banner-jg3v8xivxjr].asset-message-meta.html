                <br />
                This year has been one for the books. As we reflect, we can&rsquo;t help but be
                overwhelmed with gratitude towards you for allowing us to be part of your
                world.&nbsp;<br />
                <br />
                You have inspired us more than ever this year with your ability to persevere through
                change, but through it all, what hasn&rsquo;t changed is our belief in you and our
                confidence in what we can overcome together.&nbsp;<br />
                <br />
                We have enjoyed seeing your faces during virtual events, hearing your words in
                messages received, and celebrating with you through milestones reached.&nbsp;<br />
                <br />
                In lieu of a big hug, we have prepared a little treat just for you!</span
