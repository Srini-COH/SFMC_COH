                        <br />
                        &quot;As a breast surgeon, I get to be present in the process of
                        recommending, choosing, and providing care to patients based on what is
                        important to them,&quot; says Dr. Amin. &quot;My specialty allows me to
                        tailor the treatment and care to what patients would benefit from the
                        most.&quot;<br />
                        <br />
                        Dr. Amin enjoys spending time with her family, as well as visiting family
                        all over America, India and England. She likes spending time outdoors,
                        trying new restaurants and painting.</span
