                        Specialist in 2004 and have come to greatly appreciate the people &nbsp;I
                        work with and the patients I have the honor of helping. I am grateful to be
                        part of an organization that places respect and compassion at the
                        forefront.&nbsp;<br />

                        <b>PERSONAL: &nbsp;</b>My husband and I have four children; three boys (ages
                        24, 22, and 21) and a daughter (age 16). &nbsp;<br />

                        cancer support services, including sending patients care packages and
                        greeting cards as well as by visiting patients in the hospital and praying
                        with and for them.&nbsp;<br />
