                Hi %%FirstName%%,<br />
                <br />
                We're proud to announce that Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup>
                (CTCA) is now City of Hope<sup>&reg;</sup>.&nbsp;Our doctors are collaborating to
                enhance patient care across our national system, and we're connecting more patients
                and families to innovative treatments and expert care.<br />
                <br />
                In our first newsletter as City of Hope, we're recognizing National Cancer
                Prevention Month and examining lifestyle changes that may help prevent cancer. Dig
                into equity in cancer prevention with us and discover why factors like where someone
                lives, their race or ethnicity, their education or their income level could create
                disparities.<br />
