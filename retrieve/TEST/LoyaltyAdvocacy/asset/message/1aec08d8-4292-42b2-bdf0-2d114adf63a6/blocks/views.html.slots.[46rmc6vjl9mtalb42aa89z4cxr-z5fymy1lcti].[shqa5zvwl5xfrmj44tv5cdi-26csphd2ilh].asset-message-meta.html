                            >At CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup>, we believe that every cancer is as unique as
                            the person fighting it. In this era of precision medicine, with
                            treatment advances evolving on a regular basis, fighting cancer requires
                            truly personalized care, delivered by experts trained in the
                            complexities of a difficult disease.<br />

                            Cancer Fighters is a nationwide community - 30,000 strong - dedicated to
                            the idea that no one ever fights cancer alone. Join us and connect with
                            other patients and caregivers from CTCA who have faced the same
                            challenges and who have and want to share their support.<br />
