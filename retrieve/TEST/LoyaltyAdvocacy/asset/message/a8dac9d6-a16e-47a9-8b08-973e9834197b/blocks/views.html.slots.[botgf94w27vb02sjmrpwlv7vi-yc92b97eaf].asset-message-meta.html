                Hi %%FirstName%%,<br />
                <br />
                In this month's newsletter, we're shining a light on several health-related topics
                recognized nationally each year in March, including colorectal cancer and nutrition.
                While getting regular colorectal cancer screenings is powerful for prevention,
                proper nutrition may play a role in preventing many types of cancer, especially
                cancer of the colon and/or rectum.&nbsp;<br />
