Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
One of the most difficult considerations for patients is the conversation with children in their families about their cancer diagnosis and treatment. Adults naturally gravitate towards protecting children physically and emotionally from the things we believe can be harmful or overwhelming for them. Our silence about cancer, however, can prove to be more harmful and disruptive than helpful to children and ourselves.<br>
