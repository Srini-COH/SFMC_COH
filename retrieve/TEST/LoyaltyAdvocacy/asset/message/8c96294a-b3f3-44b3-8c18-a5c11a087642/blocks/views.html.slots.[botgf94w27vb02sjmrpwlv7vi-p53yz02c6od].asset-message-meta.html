Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
In the midst of the challenges hospitals across our nation are facing as we navigate through the COVID-19 crisis, we know that cancer doesn&rsquo;t wait, and screenings and treatment should not be delayed or postponed.<br>
<br>
With the COVID-19 virus continuing to spread, specialty hospitals like Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) are taking immediate steps to help contain the virus and support community hospitals that are bearing the brunt of pandemic-related patients, leading to delays in non-emergent care. We are welcoming cancer or surgery patients at CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup> to help alleviate the impact that disruptions in care have on a patient&rsquo;s emotional and physical state and reduce the risk of exposing a higher-risk patient population to COVID-19.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you know cancer patients that are not getting the oncology care they need right now, please contact us at&nbsp;<b><a alias="" conversion="false" data-linkto="other" href="tel:18449734448" style="color:#007FA3;text-decoration:underline;" title="844-97-FIGHT">844-97-FIGHT</a></b>, so we can directly help that person get connected to resources that can help.<br>
<br>
Our CTCA hospitals remain fully operational, have exceptional <span><a alias="" conversion="false" data-linkto="https://" href="https://www.cancercenter.com/together/patient-information" style="color:#007FA3;text-decoration:underline;" title="COVID-19 safety measures in place">COVID-19 safety measures in place</a>,</span> have immediate availability for all cancer types and use advanced technology and therapies to keep cancer patients in treatment and fighting their disease. We hope to be able to help our community hospitals and cancer patients bridge the gap during this difficult time.&nbsp;<br>
