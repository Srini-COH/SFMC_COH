Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
As the President of City of Hope<sup>&reg;</sup> Chicago, I am reaching out to you today to humbly request your support in our pursuit of state funding to continue cancer treatment for families across Illinois.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Through our recent transition to a nonprofit hospital, we have the great opportunity to serve an increased number of local and low-income patients through access to more advanced technology and research for premier cancer care. However, we are losing life-saving funds due to low Medicaid reimbursement levels and our unique position as a specialty care hospital. To maintain our high-quality care for families like yours across the region, we are seeking $9 million in state funding to bridge this loss and allow us to reach a more sustainable position of care.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
