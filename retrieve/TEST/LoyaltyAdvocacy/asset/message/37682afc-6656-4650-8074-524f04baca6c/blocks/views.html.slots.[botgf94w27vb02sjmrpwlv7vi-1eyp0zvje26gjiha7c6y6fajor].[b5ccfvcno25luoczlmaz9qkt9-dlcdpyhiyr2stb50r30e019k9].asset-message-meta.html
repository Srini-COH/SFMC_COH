Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
Our bodies are composed of about 60% water and, on the most basic level, it sustains all of the body's functions. It transports nutrients and oxygen, protects our organs and lubricates our joints. Fluids also help regulate heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
At Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA), registered dietitians work with each patient&rsquo;s care team to develop strategies to prevent dehydration during treatments including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. When at home, it's important for patients and their caregivers to recognize the symptoms of dehydration.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Please join Cancer Fighters<sup>&reg;</sup> and special guest Melissa Picchietti, RD, LDN, Clinical Oncology Dietitian at CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup> Chicago, LIVE and online Tuesday, September 1 at 2:00pm EDT.&nbsp;Melissa will discuss the importance of hydration, ways to stay hydrated and tips for reaching your daily water goal.<br>
