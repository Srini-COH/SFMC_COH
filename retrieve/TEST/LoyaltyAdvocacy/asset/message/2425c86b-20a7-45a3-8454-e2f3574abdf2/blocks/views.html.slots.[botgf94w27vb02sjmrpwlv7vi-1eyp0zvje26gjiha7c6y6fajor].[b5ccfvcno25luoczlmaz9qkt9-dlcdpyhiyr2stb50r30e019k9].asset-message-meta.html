Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
Undeniably this will be a unique holiday season.<br>
<br>
Some of the most useful advice that we've heard regarding celebrating the holidays during COVID-19 is to focus on your family's traditions that you can modify to keep your family safe. &nbsp;Keep in mind the spirit or meaning behind the tradition and then make the necessary changes. Perhaps you will even develop a new tradition for your family. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
This year to ensure everyone's safety, Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) Chicago will host the Holiday of Hope celebration virtually. Several very talented Cancer Fighters<sup>&reg;</sup> will be performing holiday songs for us. Grab a cup of hot chocolate from the comfort of your home and join us for a special Virtual Holiday of Hope on Thursday, December 17<sup>th</sup> at 5:00 p.m. EST on Zoom.&nbsp;<br>

<br>
Another annual Cancer Fighters tradition is the Holiday of Hope Trees. In years past, these special trees were decorated solely by paper ornaments written and hung by our members answering the simple question, &ldquo;What Brings You Hope?&rdquo;. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Due to COVID-19, we need to collect these answers virtually. You can help us by <a alias="clicking here" conversion="false" data-linkto="mailto:" href="mailto:cfatlanta@ctca-hope.com?subject=Holiday%20of%20Hope" style="color:#1010EE;text-decoration:underline;" title="clicking here">clicking here</a> to email your Cancer Fighters team with your answer to &quot;What Brings You Hope?&quot; We will decorate our Cancer Fighters Corner doors with your responses. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Our goal is to cover the doors with your ornaments filled with uplifting messages from Cancer Fighters to CTCA<sup>&reg;&nbsp;</sup>onsite patients to read this holiday season.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Your Cancer Fighters Team</td></tr></table>
