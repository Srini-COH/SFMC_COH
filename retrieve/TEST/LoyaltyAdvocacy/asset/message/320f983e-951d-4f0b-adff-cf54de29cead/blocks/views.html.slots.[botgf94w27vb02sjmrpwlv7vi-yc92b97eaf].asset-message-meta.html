                Hi %%FirstName%%,<br />
                <br />
                Whether providing care for a loved one with cancer, a chronic illness, disability or
                an older adult family member, caregivers help provide essential support and often
                make substantial sacrifices to keep family members safe and healthy.&nbsp;During
                National Family Caregivers Month, we encourage you to share these resources with
                your employees who may be caring for loved ones.<br />
                <br />
                This month's newsletter also shines a light two types of cancer that are recognized
                nationally in November&mdash;lung cancer and stomach cancer.
