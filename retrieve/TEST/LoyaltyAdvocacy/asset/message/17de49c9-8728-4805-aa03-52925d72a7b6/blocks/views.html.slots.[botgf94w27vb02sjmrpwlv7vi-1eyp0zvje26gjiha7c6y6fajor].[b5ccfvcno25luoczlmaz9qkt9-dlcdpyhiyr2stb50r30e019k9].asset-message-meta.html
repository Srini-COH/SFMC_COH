Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
Join us for Healthy, Happy Hour at Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) with 180&deg;&nbsp;Farm!&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
When:&nbsp;Tuesday, February 25<br>
Time:&nbsp;1:00 p.m.<br>
Where: CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup> Atlanta<br>
<br>
180&deg; Farm was created by Scott and Nicole Tyson as a way to minister to the needs of the community through education and by providing &ldquo;clean, natural&rdquo; food. With land originally intended to be a family homestead, Scott and Nicole's vision changed when their son Mason was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in 2006. Scott will share his family's story as well as information on genetically modified foods and tips on how to eat an organic diet on a budget. Light refreshments will be served.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This event is free of charge and open to the public, so be sure to invite your family and friends!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
