We invite you to share this news with your loved ones as the screenings are available to any adult, including patients, caregivers, and anyone in the community, who meet the criteria below.<br>

As of July 2020, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends proposed annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose CT scan for adults who:<ul>
	<li>
		are age 50-80 years old</li><li>
		have a 20-pack year smoking history (number of packs smoked per day multiplied by the number of years smoked)</li><li>
		currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years</li></ul>The screening and diagnostic program offers quick appointments, rapid results and access to specialists.<br>
<br>
