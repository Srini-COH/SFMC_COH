                >CTCA is collaborating with physicians in select community hospitals in Arizona,
                Georgia, and Iowa to offer advanced oncology care to patients in rural areas. These
                partnerships allow patients to visit a CTCA hospital and have telehealth services
                with board-certified physicians, allowing them to receive treatment close to home.
