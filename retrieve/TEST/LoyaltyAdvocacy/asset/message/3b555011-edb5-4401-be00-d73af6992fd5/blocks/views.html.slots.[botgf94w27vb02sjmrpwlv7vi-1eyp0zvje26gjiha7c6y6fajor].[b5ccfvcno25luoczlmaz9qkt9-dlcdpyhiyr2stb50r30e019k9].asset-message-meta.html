Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
I would like to officially welcome you into our Cancer Fighters<sup>&reg;</sup> Family! One of the many benefits of being a patient of Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) is having access to this community of support. This unique group is made up of cancer survivors, caregivers, family and friends, all here to help you and your loved ones navigate through this journey.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
By now you have received a welcome email and invitation to explore the online community. <b>And in the coming weeks, be on the lookout for a little gift in the mail from us to you!</b><br>
<br>
The Cancer Fighters Corner at CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup> Phoenix is currently closed due to COVID-19, but I want to be sure you know where to find me the next time you are at CTCA for an appointment. The Cancer Fighters Corner is located<i><b> [Arpi, can you please identify where it's at?]</b></i>. Here you can meet your Cancer Fighters team, learn about upcoming events and activities, explore the wall of resources, and connect with others just like yourself! <b>As soon as we get the all clear to reopen the space, I will let you know.</b></td></tr></table>
