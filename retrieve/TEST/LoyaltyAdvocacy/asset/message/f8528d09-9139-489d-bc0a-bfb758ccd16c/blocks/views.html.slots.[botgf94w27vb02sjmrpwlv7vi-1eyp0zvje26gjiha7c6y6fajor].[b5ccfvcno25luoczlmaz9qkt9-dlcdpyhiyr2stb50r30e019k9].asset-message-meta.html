Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
The outpouring of love and support for all staff, patients and families affected by the news of the closing of the Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;(CTCA) in Tulsa hospital has been encouraging and much appreciated.<br>
<br>
Many Cancer Fighters<sup>&reg;</sup> have reached out inquiring about ways to bid farewell and celebrate what was shared through this journey together at CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup> Tulsa. Though the building will be closed to outside visitors beginning June 1, 2021, let&rsquo;s share the love virtually with a special slideshow of the faces that turned into family.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Here's what you can do:&nbsp;<ul>
	<li>
		Submit a photo of you holding an encouraging message to <a alias="cancerfighters@ctca-hope.com" conversion="false" data-linkto="mailto:" href="mailto:cancerfighters@ctca-hope.com?subject=CTCA%20Tulsa" style="color:#1010ee;text-decoration:underline;" title="cancerfighters@ctca-hope.com">cancerfighters@ctca-hope.com</a> by Wednesday, May 26, 2021.&nbsp;</li><li>
