Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
Undeniably this will be a unique holiday season.<br>
<br>
Some of the most useful advice that we've heard regarding celebrating the holidays during COVID-19 is to focus on your family's traditions that you can modify to keep your family safe. &nbsp;Keep in mind the spirit or meaning behind the tradition and then make the necessary changes. Perhaps you will even develop a new tradition for your family. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Your Chicago Cancer Fighters<sup>&reg;</sup> team is also adjusting many of our traditions during this pandemic. For the past 13 years, we've hosted our annual Holiday of Hope<sup>&reg;</sup>. We've gathered and sang holiday carols while enjoying the lights and decorations around the hospital. While our celebration has grown and changed through the years, at the heart of this tradition is hope, joy and fellowship.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This year to ensure everyone's safety, we are hosting our Holiday of Hope celebration virtually. &nbsp;Several very talented Cancer Fighters will be preforming holiday songs for us. &nbsp;Grab a cup of hot chocolate from the comfort of your home and join us for a special Virtual Holiday of Hope on Thursday, December 17<sup>th</sup> at 4:00 p.m. (CT) on Zoom. Please note, we will not be celebrating on-site at Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) Chicago. This is a virtual event only.<br>

<br>
Another annual Cancer Fighters tradition is the Holiday of Hope Trees. In years past, these special trees were decorated solely by paper ornaments written and hung by our members answering the simple question, &ldquo;What Brings You Hope?&rdquo;. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Due to COVID-19, we need to collect these answers virtually. You can help us by <a alias="clicking here" conversion="false" data-linkto="mailto:" href="mailto:cfzion@ctca-hope.com?subject=Holiday%20of%20Hope" style="color:#1010EE;text-decoration:underline;" title="clicking here">clicking here</a> to email your Cancer Fighters team with your answer to What Bring You Hope. We will decorate our Holiday of Hope trees with our member's responses. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Our goal is to cover our Holiday of Hope Trees with ornaments filled with uplifting messages from our Cancer Fighters to our onsite patients to read this holiday season.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Your Cancer Fighters Team</td></tr></table>
