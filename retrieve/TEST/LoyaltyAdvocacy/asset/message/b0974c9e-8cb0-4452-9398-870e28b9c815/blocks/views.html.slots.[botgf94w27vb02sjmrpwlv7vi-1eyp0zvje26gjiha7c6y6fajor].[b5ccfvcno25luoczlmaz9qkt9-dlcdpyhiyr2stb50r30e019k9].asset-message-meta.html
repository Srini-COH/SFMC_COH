Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
We know that early detection and treatment of cancer leads to higher survival rates. But critical healthcare, including cancer screening, diagnosis, treatment and even surgery, continues to be delayed or canceled during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts caution this trend will produce a cancer <b>Shadow Curve</b>, or a surge in new cancer diagnoses and deaths and an increase in advanced-stage cancer cases.<br>
<br>
&quot;The medical community has been worried about this since the pandemic began. Now we are seeing the data that illustrates these disruptions in cancer care can be lethal. We are at a point where we must sound the alarm in order to save lives,&quot; says <a alias="Dr. Shayma Kazmi" conversion="false" data-linkto="https://" href="https://www.cancercenter.com/physician-directory/shayma-master-kazmi" style="color:#1010EE;text-decoration:underline;" title="Dr. Shayma Kazmi">Dr. Shayma Kazmi</a>. &quot;Cancer screenings and diagnosis are down. And that is not a good thing, because we know that cancer doesn't quarantine when we do.&quot;<br>
