                ><b>PROFESSIONAL</b>: I joined CEOT in September 2020 after working for years in
                other healthcare organizations. I have worked directly with patients undergoing
                cancer treatment, clinicians working to support the care patients receive within
                hospitals and healthcare organizations.<br />
                <br />
                <b>PERSONAL:&nbsp;</b>I met my husband when I was a student at the University of
                Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. We have been married for 13 years and we have a
                three-year-old son who keeps us on our toes.<br />
                <br />
                <b>VOLUNTEERING:</b>&nbsp;I am involved with my local food bank and recently began
                making cloth masks for friends, family, and friends of friends.<br />
                <br />
                <b>HOBBIES:</b>&nbsp;I enjoy traveling, especially across the West Coast. Prior to
                parenthood, we enjoyed hiking in Yosemite and Glacier National Park, hotel stays, no
                camping for me! We also enjoy eating at new restaurants and I really enjoy trying
                new recipes, especially baking recipes. As a family, we are often outside, visiting
                the zoo, checking out new swings at parks or taking a walk around a forest
                preserve.</span
