                        excited to meet and partner with you to provide healing and hope to not only
                        newly diagnosed patients, but also to our dedicated survivors and their
                        caregivers who have chosen to give back.<br />

                        A little bit of information about myself &ndash; when I am not at CTCA
                        Atlanta, I enjoy spending time with my husband, Michael, and our dog, a
                        Great Pyrenees named Abe. Together as a family, we enjoy running, traveling
                        and working on our ever-growing list of home improvement projects.</span
