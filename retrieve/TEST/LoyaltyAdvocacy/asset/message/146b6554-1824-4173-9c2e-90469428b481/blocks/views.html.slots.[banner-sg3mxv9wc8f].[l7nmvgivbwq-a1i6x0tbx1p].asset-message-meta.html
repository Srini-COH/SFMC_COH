                >Sheila loves kayaking, biking, bowling, golfing and dancing with her husband, and
                is a proud grandmother with an ever-growing family.<br />
                <br />
                Fun fact: Her first learned language was sign language, as she is a child of deaf
                parents.<br />
                <br />
                In her spare time, she enjoys volunteering with organizations that serve
                underprivileged children and families through educational efforts or special holiday
                events where she can help bring the magic to those who may not get a chance to
                experience the season in a big way.</span
