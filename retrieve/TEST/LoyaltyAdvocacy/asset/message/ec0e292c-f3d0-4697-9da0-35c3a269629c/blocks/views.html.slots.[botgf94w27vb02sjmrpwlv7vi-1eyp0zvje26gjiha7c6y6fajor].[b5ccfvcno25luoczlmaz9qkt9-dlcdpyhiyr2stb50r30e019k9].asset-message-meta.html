                Why is Getting Good Sleep So&nbsp;Important?&nbsp;
            </h1>
            <br />
            Do you have difficulty sleeping? You&rsquo;re not alone. Individuals with cancer, and
            even their loved ones, often report higher rates of sleep disturbances than the general
            population.<br />
            <br />
            In this article, Mike Uhl, Behavioral Health Therapist at CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup> Chicago,
            shares his experience in working with cancer patients and tips to get you on your way to
            better quality sleep.<br />
            <br />
            Mike covers topics like:&nbsp;
            <ul>
                <li>Finding your ideal conditions for a good night&rsquo;s sleep</li>
                <li>Tips to consider as you&rsquo;re nearing bedtime</li>
                <li>Techniques to help go back to sleep if you find yourself awake at night</li>
