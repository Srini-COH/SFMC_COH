Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
We're excited to launch a new <a alias="" conversion="false" data-linkto="https://" href="https://www.cancerfighters.com/s/?utm_source=cf&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=launch" style="color:#1010ee;text-decoration:underline;" title="CancerFighters.com">CancerFighters.com</a> experience! Along with a fresh look, we've improved features to allow for easier connections and discussions all in one place.<br>
<br>
With the recent announcement from Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) about the CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup> Philadelphia transition to Temple Health, we wanted to reach out to you specifically so that you know we're still here for you. The change happening will not impact our relationship with you, and Cancer Fighters<sup>&reg;</sup> is here to support you through your journey.<br>
<br>
Before you start trying all of the new site features, please note:<ul>
 <li>
  Your account from the previous website has transitioned over.&nbsp;Please use your existing username and password for the new site.</li><li>
  Once logged in, follow the Getting Started guide to update your profile. Be sure to choose a Nickname (Display Name) you're comfortable sharing with the community! It's how fellow Cancer Fighters can find you. You can always change it later under My Profile.</li></ul> We created a special <span><a alias="CTCA Philadelphia Group" conversion="false" data-linkto="https://" href="https://www.cancerfighters.com/s/group/0F94R000000XxdrSAC/ctca-philadelphia" style="color:#1010EE;text-decoration:underline;" title="CTCA Philadelphia Group">group just for CTCA Philadelphia members</a></span> in the new community. Here you'll find all the Cancer Fighters members you came to know and consider family while treating at CTCA. We hope you'll choose to continue as one of our Cancer Fighters and join us in this new space.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Your Cancer Fighters Team</td></tr></table>
