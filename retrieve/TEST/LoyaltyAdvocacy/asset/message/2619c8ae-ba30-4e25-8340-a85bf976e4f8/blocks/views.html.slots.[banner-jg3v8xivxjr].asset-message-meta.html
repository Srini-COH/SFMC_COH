                Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) is proud to introduce the
                HOPE Program.<br />
                <br />
                Every day, Cancer Fighters<sup>&reg;</sup> members empower one another by sharing
                experiences, stories, and encouragement, and now, the HOPE Program enables us to
                recognize YOU for spreading hope among your community through your participation in
                Cancer Fighters!<br />
                <br />
                Whenever we see you helping to build the Cancer Fighters community of camaraderie
                and hope for others on their cancer journeys, we will acknowledge your efforts
                through the HOPE Program by awarding you points to reach recognition milestones.
