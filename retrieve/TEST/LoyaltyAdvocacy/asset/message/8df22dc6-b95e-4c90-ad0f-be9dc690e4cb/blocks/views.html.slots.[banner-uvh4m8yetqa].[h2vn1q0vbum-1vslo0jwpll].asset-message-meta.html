                            ><b>PROFESSIONAL</b>: I have worked for CTCA for seven years. I have
                            been involved in many different aspects of CTCA, from video chat to
                            guiding a patient from his or her initial call to scheduling an
                            appointment at one of our Comprehensive Care and Research Centers. I
                            love working for an organization that gives me the opportunity to help
                            others, which leaves me feeling good about myself and what I do every
                            single day.&nbsp;<br />

                            <b>VOLUNTEER WORK</b>: I volunteer at my daughter&rsquo;s school as much
                            as possible. I also help in the community by coaching soccer and
                            volunteering at fundraising events, including supporting diabetes
                            organizations.&nbsp;<br />
                            <br />
                            <b>PERSONAL</b>: I have been married for 11 years and have two wonderful
                            children, a nine-year old daughter and a seven-year old son.&nbsp;<br />
                            <br />
                            <b>HOBBIES</b>: My husband and I like trying new cuisines and
                            restaurants. I also enjoy traveling to different parts of the world and
                            new adventures, such as a sky diving, which I did this year for the
                            first time. I believe, &ldquo;life is short, so live it to the
                            fullest.&rdquo;</span
