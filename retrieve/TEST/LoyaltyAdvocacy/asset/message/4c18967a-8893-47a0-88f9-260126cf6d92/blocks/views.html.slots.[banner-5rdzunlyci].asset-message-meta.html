										<br>
										As you may already know, current state law restricts Cancer Treatment Centers of America&reg; (CTCA) in Newnan to seeing just 35% of its patients from Georgia and caps our hospital at 50 inpatient beds. We have legislation in both the House and Senate that contains language to address this issue by removing these restrictions and allowing CTCA&reg; to operate as a General Hospital focused solely on adult cancer care under the same Certificate of Need rules that govern other hospitals.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										We are excited to announce that House Bill 198 will be on the floor for a full House of Representatives vote tomorrow, March 7! Would you be willing to reach out today to your State Representative to let him/her know that you support House Bill 198?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										If you are more comfortable with email, I have a sample message below to help get you started. But you are certainly welcome and encouraged to personalize the email! If you need assistance identifying your Representative, or finding his/her contact information, please <a alias="click this link" conversion="false" data-linkto="https://" href="https://openstates.org/find_your_legislator/?address=" style="color:#808080;text-decoration:underline;" title="click this link">click this link</a> or call 770-400-6257.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										<i>Representative (add your Representative's name here),<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										I urge you to support HB 198. Here's why (share personal piece of your story/your reason for advocacy).&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										All Georgians should have the right to choose where they receive their cancer care. Isn't that what you would want if you or a loved one was diagnosed with cancer?</i><br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										<i>As your constituent, I am asking for your support on this issue.</i><br>
										<br>
										Sincerely,<br>
										Your Cancer Fighters Team<br>
