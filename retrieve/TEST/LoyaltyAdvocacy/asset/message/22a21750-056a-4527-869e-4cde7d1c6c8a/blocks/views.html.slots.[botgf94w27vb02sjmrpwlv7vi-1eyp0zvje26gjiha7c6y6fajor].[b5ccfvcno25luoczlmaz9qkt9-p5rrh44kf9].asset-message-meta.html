The Celebrate Life<sup>&reg;</sup> Survivor Tree is a longstanding embodiment of strength, perseverance and hope at Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA).<br>
<br>
Throughout the years, a personal leaf has been placed on the Survivor Tree for each CTCA<sup>&reg;&nbsp;</sup>patient reaching his or her five-year milestone and, over time, countless leaves formed a tapestry of personal stories and journeys.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Now, the Survivor Tree has a new look and enhanced experience. It's available on <a alias="" conversion="false" data-linkto="https://" href="https://www.cancerfighters.com/s/survivortree?utm_source=cancerfighters&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=weeklyevents" style="color:#007FA3;text-decoration:underline;" title="CancerFighters.com">CancerFighters.com</a>, allowing everyone to access these beautiful stories anytime, anywhere.</td></tr></table>
