Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
We would like to start off by saying thank you for being a valued member of Cancer Fighters<sup>&reg;</sup>. Now more than ever, your efforts in sharing your stories and connecting with other Cancer Fighters members are of the utmost importance in creating a community of Cancer Fighters who nurture, empower and engage with one another.<br>
<br>
Because of this, we have an important task for you. In recognition of National Family Caregivers Month this November, we would like to encourage you to share with us a few photos of you and your caregiver(s) along with a few sentences about what they mean to you! We will plan to share these with other Cancer Fighters members and caregivers through Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) digital platforms and social media pages in an effort to help highlight the very important role caregivers and loved ones hold each and every day.<br>
<br>

We appreciate all that you do in creating a sense of camaraderie and hope in the Cancer Fighters Community, and we look forward to celebrating your caregivers with your meaningful photos and words.<br>
