Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
We would like to start off by saying thank you for being a valued member of Cancer Fighters<sup>&reg;</sup> Care Net (CFCN). Now more than ever, your efforts in sharing your stories and connecting with other Cancer Fighters members are of the utmost importance in creating a community of Cancer Fighters who nurture, empower and engage with one another.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Because of this, we have an important task for you. We would like to encourage you, your caregivers and family members to provide a short, one-minute video testimonial about your journey with cancer and Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA). We will plan to share these with other Cancer Fighters members, as well as new patients through our digital platforms including our social media pages and website.&nbsp;<br>

A few helpful filming tips:&nbsp;<ol>
	<li>
		Make sure you are filming yourself in a well-lit, quiet location.</li><li>
		Perform a few test runs! Have yourself, family member or friend film a few times to check the sound and visual quality prior to filming your testimonial. Be sure to have all of the important details you&rsquo;d like to highlight in mind. One minute will go by quickly!</li><li>
		Make sure to wear solid, dark colored clothing. Please refrain from wearing any hats or baseball caps that may block your face.</li><li>
		If you will be filming yourself, be sure to hold the camera steady. It can even work well to prop your phone up using a table or chair while filming.&nbsp;</li></ol>We appreciate all that you do in creating a sense of camaraderie and hope in the Cancer Fighters Community, and we look forward to seeing your video testimonial!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Your Cancer Fighters Team<br>
