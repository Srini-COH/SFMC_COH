                >Jamie is enthusiastic about soccer. She loves spending her free time coaching,
                watching or doing anything that's soccer related. Her son's budding career in the
                sport helps keep her busy with all things soccer, as she loves to be there cheering
                him on from the sidelines for every game.<br />
                <br />When she's not busy with sports, she enjoys volunteering for special events
                for nonprofit organizations, which is something she once did for her career.
