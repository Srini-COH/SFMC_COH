                        >&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very grateful to be a new member of this passionate team.
                        Previously, I worked in behavioral health with a focus on pediatric autism.
                        I partnered with pediatricians&nbsp;and specialists to identify symptoms
                        early and have up-to-date knowledge on all available treatment&nbsp;options.
                        I am privileged to continue to listen and support patients and their
                        families to help meet their needs and support them through their
                        journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span

                to attend Broadway performances together. I have a beautiful sister, a survivor of

                one another and I am very involved as her caregiver. This work is my honor. I engage
