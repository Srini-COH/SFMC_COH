                This month being National Colorectal Cancer Awareness month, a much-needed spotlight
                is cast on the importance of early detection. Colorectal cancer is the fourth most
                common cancer in the United States&nbsp;and, according to the American Cancer
                Society, an estimated 151,030 people will be diagnosed this year. If caught before
                it spreads to other parts of the body, the five-year survival rate increases to 90
                percent. Check out the resources below on screening guidelines, symptoms&nbsp;and
                more.&nbsp;
