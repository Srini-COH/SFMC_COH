Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
As you may have seen in the news, communities are coming together more than ever amidst this pandemic. Our Cancer Fighters<sup>&reg;</sup> community is strong and here to support one another through this unprecedented time. While Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) hospitals are currently stocked, our need for personal protective equipment is vital. As we explore options to secure additional manufactured safety equipment, we are engaging community volunteers and organizations around the country in an empowering effort: to make hand-sewn, carefully constructed surgical masks, to help avoid any potential shortfall.<br>
<br>
If you are interested and able to help with this request, please email us at <a alias="cancerfighter@ctca-hope.com" conversion="false" data-linkto="mailto:" href="mailto:cancerfighter@ctca-hope.com?subject=PPE%20Mask" style="color:#007FA3;text-decoration:underline;" title="cancerfighter@ctca-hope.com">cancerfighter@ctca-hope.com</a>. We can provide you with criteria, sewing instructions and delivery options. We appreciate any donations, but this is also a great way to support your local community.<br>
<br>
We appreciate you and wish you well!<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Your Cancer Fighters Team</td></tr></table>
