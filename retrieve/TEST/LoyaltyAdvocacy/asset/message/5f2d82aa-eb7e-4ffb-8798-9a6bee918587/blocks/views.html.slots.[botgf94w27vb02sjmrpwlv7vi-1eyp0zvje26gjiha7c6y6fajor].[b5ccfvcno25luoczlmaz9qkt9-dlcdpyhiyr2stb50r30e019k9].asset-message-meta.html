                Need to relax? Here are nine easy ways&nbsp;to help ease your stress.
            </h1>
            <br />
            It may seem hard to relax these days when there are so many rules in place to help us
            stay safe from COVID-19. Wear a mask. Wash your hands. Make sure you&rsquo;re social
            distancing. Add a cancer diagnosis and treatment schedule to the mix, and the stress may
            seem overwhelming. If you&rsquo;re a cancer patient, however, these new rules of social
            engagement are critical to helping you avoid a COVID-19 infection and the potentially
            severe symptoms the virus may cause.
