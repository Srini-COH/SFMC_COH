Some of the most useful advice that we have heard regarding celebrating the holidays during COVID-19 is to focus on your family's traditions that you can modify to keep your family safe. Keep in mind the spirit or meaning behind the tradition and then make the necessary changes needed to celebrate this season. Perhaps you will even develop a new tradition with your family this year!<br>
<br>
Cancer Fighters<sup>&reg;</sup> is also creating new traditions this year! The team has missed celebrating in-person with you this holiday season, but we have a few ways to celebrate together virtually!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Here's 3 ways to get involved with Cancer Fighters this holiday season:<ol>
	<li>
		Answer the question, &quot;What Brings you Hope?&quot; and <a alias="email" conversion="false" data-linkto="mailto:" href="mailto:cancerfighter@ctca-hope.com?subject=Holiday%20of%20Hope" style="color:#1010EE;text-decoration:underline;" title="email">email</a> your answer to your Cancer Fighters team. We will plan to share these answers on our Holiday of Hope ornaments, and showcase them on-site at Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> &nbsp;(CTCA) hospitals around the country to spread joy!&nbsp;</li><li>
		Snap a photo of yourself holding a sign with a holiday message to share with your favorite nurse, care team, clinician, oncologist or fellow cancer survivor. <a alias="Email" conversion="false" data-linkto="mailto:" href="mailto:cancerfighter@ctca-hope.com?subject=Holiday%20of%20Hope" style="color:#1010EE;text-decoration:underline;" title="Email">Email</a> your Cancer Fighters team&nbsp;and we will be sure to get those messages to the intended recipient.</li><li>
		Join us for a special virtual Holiday of Hope celebration from the comfort of your own home on Thursday, December 17 at 5:00 p.m. EST. <a alias="Click here" conversion="false" data-linkto="http://" href="http://ctca.force.com/cancerfighters/s/event/a064R000011LvhUQAS/live-virtual-event-series-14th-annual-holiday-of-hope" style="color:#1010ee;text-decoration:underline;" title="Click here">Click here</a> to register.</li></ol><br>
Cancer Fighters is a community of support. As we enter into this holiday season, let's continue to lean on one another for hope and inspiration.&nbsp;<br>
