                            ><b>PROFESSIONAL:</b> I joined CTCA in 2010. I previously worked in the
                            high-tech field helping companies like GE Medical build out and supply
                            our nations hospitals with imaging systems like PET/CT and MRI rooms.
                            Medicine and the human body have always been interesting to me.<br />

                            <b>PERSONAL:</b> &nbsp;I am a 5 time triple negative breast cancer
                            survivor, having found breast cancer when I was 30 years old and 7
                            months pregnant. After many years of surgeries, testing, chemo and
                            radiation, I found my true calling working at CTCA to speak with other
                            cancer patients.<br />

                            <b>VOLUNTEER WORK:</b> &nbsp;I have worked for the Relay for Life and
                            the Susan G Komen society for many years. I think fundraising is such a
                            great way to give back and help those in need.<br />

                            <b>HOBBIES</b>: I am an avid reader and love watching historical dramas.
                            I am pretty good with DIY projects and have a full complement of tools
                            and devices to make me pretty 'dangerous' around the house.</span
