                >Jan loves to travel, golf, sail and spend quality time with family, friends and her
                fur baby Pebbles. Through her own personal health journey, she's learned to slow
                down, be present and focus on gratitude and resilience.<br />
                <br />"My health journey was impacted with a meningioma brain tumor behind my right
                eye. How I learned about my tumor was when I contracted COVID-19 from my Mom in
                January of 2021, who lost her life trying to fight the virus. Despite the sadness of
                the loss of my Mom, it was a blessing she inadvertendly helped bring awareness to
                the tumor."
