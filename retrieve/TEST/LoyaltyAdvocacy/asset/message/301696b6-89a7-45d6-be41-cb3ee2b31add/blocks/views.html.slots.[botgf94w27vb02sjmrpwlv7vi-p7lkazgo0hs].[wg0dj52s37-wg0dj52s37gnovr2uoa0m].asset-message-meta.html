Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>

Let's get into the holiday spirit with the Cancer Fighters<sup>&reg;</sup> Holiday Card Exchange! Help spread seasonal cheer by writing to a fellow Cancer Fighters member, and in return, you'll receive a card in the mail.<br>
<br>
Here's how it works: <a alias="" conversion="false" data-linkto="https://" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/MGMB65R" style="color:#007FA3;text-decoration:underline;" title="Sign up to participate">Sign up to participate</a> by <b>November 17</b>. You'll then receive a card in the mail to fill out and sign. Return it to the Cancer Fighters Team, then watch your mail this December for a holiday card from a fellow member.</td></tr></table>
