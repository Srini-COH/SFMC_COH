Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
<br>
For the second year in a row, Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) Chicago is pleased to announce it has received a five-star quality rating from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Awarded annually, the overall hospital star rating summarizes a wide range of more than 50 measures on Hospital Compare into a single metric. Hospital Compare is a consumer-oriented website that provides information on how well each hospital performed, on average, compared to other hospitals in the U.S., thus helping patients determine which hospitals will provide the best care for them. The overall hospital rating ranges from one to five stars, with the national average at three stars.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This year, the CMS Hospital Compare website reported on quality measures for more than 4,500 hospitals nationwide. Measures reflected cover seven aspects of quality including mortality, safety of care, readmission, patient experience, effectiveness of care, timeliness of care and efficient use of medical imaging.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you know someone who will benefit from our five-star cancer care, <a alias="please click here" conversion="false" data-linkto="https://" href="https://www.cancerfighter.com/give-support/refer-a-friend/" style="color:#007FA3;text-decoration:underline;" title="please click here">please click here</a>.<br>
