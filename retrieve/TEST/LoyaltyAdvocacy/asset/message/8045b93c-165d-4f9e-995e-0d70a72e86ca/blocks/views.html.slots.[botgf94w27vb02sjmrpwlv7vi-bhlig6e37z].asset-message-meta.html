									Dear %%=v(@FirstName)=%%,<br>
									<br>
									In March, we made the difficult decision to postpone Celebrate Life for our 2020 Celebrants due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We wanted to let you know that we are still working on rescheduling the event but we are still in uncertain times and can&rsquo;t announce anything at this point. As soon as we are able to make an announcement, we will be sure to send you an update.<br>
									<br>
									We do want to keep the spirit and celebration of your accomplishment going by getting you involved in one of the traditions of Celebrate Life - putting your leaf on the Interactive Survivor Tree (IST). At each of our hospitals, we feature the IST which holds all of our past Celebrants (who choose to participate) names and other important information to honor each patients journey. &nbsp;The IST is a place to remember and commemorate your valiant fight with cancer and provide inspiration to those who may be just starting their journey.<br>
									<br>
									This electronic tree is a great way to showcase milestones in your journey, recognize those who have helped you along the way or simply express your feelings about your accomplishments. It is easy to Share Your Story. We have created a simple form that asks you a few questions about your cancer journey.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
