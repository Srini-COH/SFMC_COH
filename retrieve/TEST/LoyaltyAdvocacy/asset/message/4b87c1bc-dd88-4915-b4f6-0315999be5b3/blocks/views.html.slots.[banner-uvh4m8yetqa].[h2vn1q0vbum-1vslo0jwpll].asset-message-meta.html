                ><b>PROFESSIONAL</b>: I have been with CTCA for the past 10 years as a Senior
                Patient Advocate. I have expedited first appointments for thousands of patients from
                their very first call until they are in the hands of their care team at a CTCA
                hospital.<br />
                <br />
                <b>PERSONAL:&nbsp;</b>My husband and I have a beautiful daughter who is married with
                two little girls that keep us young and laughing all the time. Our dog, Jack, is an
                almost 15 year old Labrador who takes us for a walk multiple times a day and shows
                us how to never give up.<br />
                <br />
                <b>VOLUNTEERING:</b>&nbsp;In the past, I have co-chaired multiple events and
                charitable balls to give back to my local community. We also help within our
                church.<br />
                <br />
                <b>HOBBIES:</b>&nbsp;I have traveled the world extensively throughout the years. I
                love building, rehabbing and redecorating homes. I have a newfound love of health
                and wellness. I find peace in meditation, art and music of all kinds.&nbsp;</span
