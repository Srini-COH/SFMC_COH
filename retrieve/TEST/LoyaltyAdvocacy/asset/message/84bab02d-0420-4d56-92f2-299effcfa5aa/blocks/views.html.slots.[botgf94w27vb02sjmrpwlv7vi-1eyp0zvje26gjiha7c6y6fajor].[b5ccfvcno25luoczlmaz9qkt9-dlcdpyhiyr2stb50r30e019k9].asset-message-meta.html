                A Message from CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup> President and Chief Executive Officer, Pat Basu,
                MD, MBA
            </h1>
            <br />
            Our commitment to delivering the Mother Standard<sup>&reg;</sup> of care is deeply
            rooted in the idea that within our hospitals, we're a family. Amid this past year's
            challenges, we relied on one another at work, at home and in our communities in ways we
            never have before. We learned through often-difficult times that we are indeed stronger
            together. Happy New Year from all of us at CTCA! Here's to an even brighter 2021!
