                            ><b>PROFESSIONAL:</b> I have been with CTCA for over three years. I have
                            spent my entire professional career in the healthcare industry. I truly
                            have a passion for helping others and I love that my professional career
                            has helped me live out this passion in every role that I have had.<br />
                            <br />
                            <b>PERSONAL:</b> I was born and raised in Oklahoma (home of all the
                            tornadoes). I married my high school sweetheart Heather and we have been
                            married 18 years. We have two awesome boys: Aidan and Mason.<br />
                            <br />
                            <b>VOLUNTEERING:</b> I love to give-back to my community. I currently am
                            on the Board of Director for &quot;Big Brothers and Big Sisters.&quot; I
                            also volunteer as a Big Brother and my &quot;little&quot; brother is 13
                            years old. I am very involved with my local church and have been serving
                            there since 2007.<br />
                            <br />
                            <b>HOBBIES:</b> I love spending time with my family. With two athletic
                            boys, I spend a lot of time on football fields, basketball courts,
                            soccer fields and lacrosse games. If I ever get time to myself, I enjoy
                            playing golf, tennis and basketball. I also have been playing the drums
                            since I was four years old and play at my local church.</span
