                        disease burden and premature death rates in cancer (in addition to many
                        other illnesses) being well-documented, little progress has been made in
                        reducing them. Even when physicians and health professionals are aware of
                        these disparities, they may be unaware of how to handle these disparities
                        when it comes to their own patients.&nbsp;<br />

                        In this series, the faculty will discuss the health disparities within
                        cancer care, uncover some of the hurdles to providing better care, and
                        expound on how health systems, communities and larger health care ecosystem
                        can empower patients, providers, payors and others to build trust, provide
                        access and use evidence-based practices to help advance health
                        equity.&nbsp;</span
