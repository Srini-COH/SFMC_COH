                ><b>PROFESSIONAL</b>:&nbsp; I joined CTCA&reg; as an Oncology Information Specialist
                in 2005. &nbsp;I have been one of the &ldquo;first voices&rdquo; of CTCA and a
                patient advocate for over 15 years. &nbsp;I am blessed and so grateful to be part of
                an organization that puts the patient, and their healing, first and offers
                integrative and compassionate cancer care.<br />
                <br />
                <b>PERSONAL:&nbsp;</b>I have been married to my husband, Brad, for over 21 years.
                &nbsp;We have two wonderful children, Sara and Kyle. &nbsp;We also have a spunky
                rescue dog, Wrigley (named after Wrigley Field because we are HUGE Chicago Cubs
                Fans). &nbsp;GO CUBBIES!<br />
                <br />
                <b>VOLUNTEERING:</b>&nbsp; I volunteer and run the fundraising efforts for my
                children&rsquo;s different athletic teams. &nbsp;I also volunteer for the YMCA at
                Camp Duncan which is an overnight/day camp for inner city children as well as
                children with medical needs such as, burn camp, diabetes camp, and cystic fibrosis
                camp.<br />
                <br />
                <b>HOBBIES:</b>&nbsp;In our free time, you will find us cheering on our children,
                whether it be our daughter playing Volleyball or our son playing Football,
                Basketball or Baseball.&nbsp; My family and I also love to travel, attend college
                and professional sporting events as well as spending time with extended family and
                friends!</span
