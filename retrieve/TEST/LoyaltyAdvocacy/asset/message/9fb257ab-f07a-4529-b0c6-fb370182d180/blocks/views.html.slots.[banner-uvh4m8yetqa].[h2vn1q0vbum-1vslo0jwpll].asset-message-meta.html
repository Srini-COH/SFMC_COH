                            I joined the CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup> Phoenix team 2 years ago after
                            dedicating 7 years of service to the CTCA Chicago hospital serving our
                            patients and caregivers. I have worked in many different capacities
                            within CTCA, ranging from Patient Accounts to leading the Business
                            Services department here in Phoenix.<br />
                            <br />
                            I am a married mother of two children, one of which also dedicates her
                            life to serving our patients' at CTCA Chicago. I am a 2-year Triple
                            Negative Breast Cancer Survivor so I know first-hand just how cancer can
                            impact everyone involved.</span
