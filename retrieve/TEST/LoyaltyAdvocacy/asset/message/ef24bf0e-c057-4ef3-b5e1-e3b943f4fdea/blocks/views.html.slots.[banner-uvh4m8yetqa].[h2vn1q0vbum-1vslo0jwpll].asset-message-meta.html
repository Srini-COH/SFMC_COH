                eight years. She is a first grade teacher, and we have two wonderful children,
                Jameson, five years, and Logan, three years. &nbsp;<br />

                <b>VOLUNTEERING:</b>&nbsp;I help in my community by coaching T-ball and volunteering
                at local schools and organizations during fundraising events. &nbsp;I enjoy
                volunteering for St. Baldrick&rsquo;s Foundation and Matthias Academy.<br />
                <br />
                <b>HOBBIES:</b>&nbsp;I enjoy traveling with my family, playing golf and playing
                bagpipes. I have performed the bagpipes at many CTCA events and also competed
                several times at the annual World Pipe Band Championships in Glasgow, Scotland.
