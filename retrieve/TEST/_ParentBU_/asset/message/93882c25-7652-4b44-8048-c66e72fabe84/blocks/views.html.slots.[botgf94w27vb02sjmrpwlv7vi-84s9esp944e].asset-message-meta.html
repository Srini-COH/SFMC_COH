                >CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup> teams are working around the clock to bring necessary care to
                those who need it. In addition to taking every precautionary measure to ensure their
                health and safety, we are rapidly enhancing telehealth capabilities across our
                hospital network to protect patients and hospital teams, while still keeping
                patients connected with their providers and maintaining continuity of their care.
