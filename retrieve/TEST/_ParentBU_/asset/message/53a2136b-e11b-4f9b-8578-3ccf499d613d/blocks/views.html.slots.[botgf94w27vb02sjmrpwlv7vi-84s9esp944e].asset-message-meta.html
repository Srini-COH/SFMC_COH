                >We&rsquo;ve heard from so many cancer patients over the past two weeks, and we know
                that you may have questions about your care. Please know that CTCA teams are working
                around the clock to answer any and all of your questions, change travel plans and
                bring cancer care to those who need it. As well as taking every precautionary
                measure to ensure our patients&rsquo; health and safety, we&rsquo;ve rapidly
                deployed telehealth capabilities across our hospital network to protect patients,
                while keeping them connected with their providers and maintaining continuity of
                their care.
