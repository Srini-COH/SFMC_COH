                Dear Dr. [NAME],<br />
                &nbsp;<br />
                As the Medical Director of the Lung Center at Cancer Treatment Centers of
                America&reg; (CTCA) in Tulsa, I am focused on how to best fight and treat lung
                cancer. Studies* have shown that screening high-risk individuals with low-dose CT
                scans could reduce lung cancer mortality by 20 percent, so I&rsquo;m pleased to
                share that the CTCA&reg; facility in Tulsa is now offering services for lung cancer
                screening and diagnosis.<br />
                &nbsp;<br />
                The U.S. Preventative Task Force recommends annual screening for lung cancer with a
                low-dose CT scan for the following patients:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>55 to 80 years old</li>
                <li>30+ pack-year smoking history</li>
                <li>Currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years</li>
            </ul>
            &nbsp;<br />
            Our program offers:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Quick Appointments &ndash; Patients are typically seen the same week they call
                    for an appointment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rapid Results &ndash; Screening results are delivered to you and your patient
                    quickly, often within 48 hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Access to Specialists &ndash; If your patient needs additional follow-up, CTCA
                    offers quick access to a multidisciplinary team of board-certified
                    interventional radiologists and pulmonologists as well as thoracic surgeons to
                    diagnose and manage any aspect of thoracic malignancy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Patient Follow-up &ndash; Our screening software system helps ensure patients
                    don&rsquo;t miss crucial follow-up appointments and that you are notified of the
                    latest with their care.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                &nbsp;<br />
                Please find a lung cancer screening guideline poster that a few of your colleagues
                requested to share with patients
