                >We&rsquo;ve heard from so many cancer patients since this coronavirus outbreak
                reached the US, and we know that you may have questions about your care. Your care
                team will keep you updated with precautionary measures we are taking to ensure all
                patients&rsquo; health and safety. Please know that CTCA teams are working around
                the clock to answer any and all of your questions, as well as to ensure that
                everyone who needs cancer care can access it, in some cases through telehealth
                capabilities which weâ€™ve rapidly deployed across our hospital network. Wherever
                appropriate, telehealth appointments will be used to protect patients, while
                maintaining continuity of care and connections to doctors and care teams.
