                >Many patients worry about how cancer will impact their lives, and waiting for test
                results may create a great deal of stress.<br />
                <br />
                At Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA), we understand that
                feeling. To ease anxiety and help begin your cancer treatment sooner, an onsite lab
                at each hospital enables us to provide reduced wait times for appointments and test
                results.<br />
                <br />
                Consider&nbsp;getting a second opinion and personalized treatment plan from
                CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup>. You can get started by letting us

                Because of the complexity involved in how insurance plans are designed, the best way
                to understand your coverage at CTCA is to share your current insurance information
                with us.<br />
                <br />
                We'll work directly with your insurance company to verify your available benefits
                then help you understand what options are available to you.&nbsp;This review is
                confidential and will not generate an insurance claim. It's simply a way for us to
                identify what coverage you have available.</span
