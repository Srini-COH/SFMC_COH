                >Dear City&nbsp;of&nbsp;Hope patient,<br />
                <br />
                The federal COVID-19 Public Health Emergency declaration ended on May 11, 2023. This
                date impacts many areas of our care, including a change to the resources we have
                provided to our patients and caregivers.<br />
                <br />
                Many City&nbsp;of&nbsp;Hope Chicago patients and caregivers received
                pandemic-related travel and accommodations benefits during the public health
                emergency. In alignment with the end of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, we
                will return to prepandemic benefits rates beginning October 1, 2023. Note, this will
                not impact rates for appointments prior to October 1, 2023, or for reservations
                already booked as of September 15, 2023.<br />
                <br />
                We understand that each situation is unique and encourage you to contact Patient
