                            Thanks again for talking with me about your situation. I'm glad we were
                            able to connect. How are you feeling? I hope this finds you well.<br />
                            <br />
                            Would you mind sharing where you are in terms of receiving a diagnosis?
                            Last time we spoke you were waiting on results. Is that still
                            true?</span
