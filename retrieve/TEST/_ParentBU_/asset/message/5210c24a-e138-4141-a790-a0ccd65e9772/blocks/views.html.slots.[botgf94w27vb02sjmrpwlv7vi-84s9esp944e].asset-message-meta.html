                that you may have questions about your care. Please know that CTCA teams are working
                around the clock to answer any and all of your questions, change travel plans and
                bring cancer care to those who need it. As well as taking every precautionary
                measure to ensure our patients&rsquo; health and safety, we&rsquo;ve rapidly
                deployed telehealth capabilities across our hospital network to protect patients,
                while keeping them connected with their providers and maintaining continuity of
                their care.

                    do, we are contacting other hospitals to see if their cancer patients need to
                    come to our facility to enable them to focus on COVID-19. We are working with
                    governments to ensure necessary materials and supplies are available for
                    delivering lifesaving cancer therapy.
