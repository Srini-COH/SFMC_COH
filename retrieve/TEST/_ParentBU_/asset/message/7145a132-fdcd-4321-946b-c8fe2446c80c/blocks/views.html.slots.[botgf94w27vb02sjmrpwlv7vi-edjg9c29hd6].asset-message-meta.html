                    Immunotherapy treatment is an option only for some patients with&nbsp;certain
                    types of cancer. The treatment may also work better for some patients than
                    others, so if you undergo immunotherapy, your oncologist would closely monitor
                    your progress and may recommend the treatment be used in combination with other
                    options.<br />

                    whether immunotherapy or other treatment options are right for you, helping you
