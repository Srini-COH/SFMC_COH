                larger health care system. Given that cancer is everything and the only thing we do,
                we are contacting other hospitals to see if their cancer patients need to come to
                our facility to enable them to focus on COVID-19. We are working with governments to
                ensure necessary materials and supplies are available for delivering lifesaving
                cancer therapy.
