                >CTCA has been preparing to play an even greater role in cancer care by exploring
                partnership opportunities that will enhance our ability to expand over three decades
                of unparalleled patient experience and quality.<br />
                <br />
                While the full details of a partnership are being determined, we are in active
                conversations with a single partner who shares our CTCA values of patient-centered
                and quality care. We do not expect any impact on patient care now or in the future.
                Quality care and the delivery of the Mother Standard of care will continue to be our
                focus.<br />
                <br />
                We look forward to updating you as more information becomes available.<br />
                <br />
                Thank you,<br />
