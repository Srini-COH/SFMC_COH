                >Dear&nbsp;City of Hope patient,<br />
                <br />
                The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced a national shortage of two
                platinum-based generic chemotherapy drugs, cisplatin and carboplatin.&nbsp;According
                to our records these drugs may be part of your treatment plan.<br />
                <br />
                City of Hope&nbsp;is closely monitoring the situation, and we are carefully
                preparing for alternative treatments to be used, if needed. Your care team will
                contact you to discuss alternative treatment options should the need arise.&nbsp;<br />
                <br />
                We remain hopeful and committed to using every available resource to provide you
                with the best available care.<br />
                <br />
                We will keep you informed regarding updates on this situation.<br />
                <br />
                Sincerely,<br />
                <br />
