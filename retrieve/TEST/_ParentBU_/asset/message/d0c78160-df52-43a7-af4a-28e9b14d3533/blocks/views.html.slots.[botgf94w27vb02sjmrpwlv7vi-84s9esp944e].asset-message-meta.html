                >Valued Patients and Caregivers,<br />
                <br />
                You and your healing are at the center of our hearts, minds and actions, every day.
                Therefore, we want to share with you first that Cancer Treatment Centers of
                America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) has accepted a proposal from Temple Health to acquire
                <span>CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup> Philadelphia</span> with an anticipated transition to
                occur by the end of <span>June 2021,</span> subject to regulatory approvals and
                closing conditions.<br />
                <br />
                Given our cherished relationship with you, please know that we would not make this
                decision lightly. This difficult past year has highlighted this community&rsquo;s
                unique needs for optimal patient access locally as well as expanded access to
                services beyond cancer care.<br />
                <br />
                Our top priority during this transition is to provide an appropriate and seamless
                transition of your care. We would love to continue to have the privilege of caring
                for you and are prepared to arrange your future care with a talented care team at a
                CTCA location of your preference. However, knowing that some patients may prefer to
                stay local, we can also facilitate a transition of care to Temple Health&rsquo;s Fox
                Chase Cancer Center (located less than five miles from our facility), or another
                provider you may select.<br />
                <br />
                If you have a scheduled appointment with CTCA Philadelphia,
                <u><b>there is no action needed on your part</b></u
                >. In the next several days, our team will reach out and begin to walk you through
                next steps, as it is critical that you continue with appropriate medical care. If
                you have general questions, please view

                Thank you for your patience and understanding as we work through this transition. As
                always, we are committed to delivering the Mother Standard<sup>&reg;</sup> of
                care.<br />
