                    <br />
                    Dealing with cancer can be overwhelming. Connecting with others who are also
                    fighting cancer can be empowering.<br />
                    <br />
                    That's why at City&nbsp;of&nbsp;Hope<sup>&reg;</sup>, we have a large team of
                    patient and caregiver volunteers who are available to speak with you. These
                    volunteers share their stories, answer your questions and offer insight on their
                    experiences. We call this team our Cancer Fighters<sup>&reg;</sup> Care Network
                    (CFCN).<br />
                    <br />
                    Would you like to speak with a patient or caregiver? CFCN volunteers have a
                    broad range of experiences, and we could find someone for you to talk to about a
                    variety of challenges, including:</span
