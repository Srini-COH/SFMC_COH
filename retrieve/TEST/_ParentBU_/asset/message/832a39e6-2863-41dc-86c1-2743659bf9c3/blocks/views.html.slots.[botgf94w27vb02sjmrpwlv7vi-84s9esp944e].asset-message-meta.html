                >Valued Patients and Caregivers,<br />
                <br />
                You and your healing are at the center of our hearts, minds and actions, every day.
                Therefore, it is with a heavy heart and great sadness we share that after over 30
                years of faithfully serving this community, Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup
                    >&reg;</sup
                >
                (CTCA) Tulsa will close operations as of June 1, 2021.<br />
                <br />
                Given our cherished relationship with you, please know that we did not make this
                decision lightly. We have worked tirelessly over multiple years to overcome the
                insurmountable patient access and insurance limitations for CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup>
                Tulsa, highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, that have inexplicably restricted
                patient care options and prevented choice. After exhausting all options,
                unfortunately, we realized the Oklahoma market was not going to expand options for
                patients to treat at CTCA Tulsa, which led to this very difficult decision.<br />
                <br />
                Our top priority during this transition is to provide an appropriate and seamless
                transition of your care. We would love to continue to have the privilege of caring
                for you and are prepared to arrange your future care with a talented care team at a
                CTCA location of your preference. However, knowing that some patients may prefer to
                stay local, we can also facilitate a transition of care to another provider you may
                select.<br />
                <br />
                If you have a scheduled appointment with CTCA Tulsa,
                <u><b>there is no action needed on your part</b></u
                >. We will continue to provide patient care in Tulsa over the next 60 days, while
                also partnering with our patients to transition their care. In the next several
                days, our team will reach out and begin to walk you through next steps, as it is
                critical that you continue with appropriate medical care. If you have general
                questions, please view
