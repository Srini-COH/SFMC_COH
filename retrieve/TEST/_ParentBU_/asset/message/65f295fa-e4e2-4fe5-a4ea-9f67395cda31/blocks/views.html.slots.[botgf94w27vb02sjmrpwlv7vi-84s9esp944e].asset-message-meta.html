                >Dear Respected, Valued and Loved Patients, Cancer&nbsp;Fighters and Caregivers,<br />
                <br />
                Several years ago, we embarked on a path with the bold vision to expand the reach of
                the Mother&nbsp;Standard<sup>&reg;</sup> of care to hundreds of thousands of
                patients, caregivers and others in need. During this journey, we identified a
                nationally renowned organization that shares our values and determination to give
                people the chance to live longer, better and more fully through their battle with
                cancer. &nbsp;<br />
                &nbsp;<br />
                Today, we are pleased to share our intention to join

                    ></b
                >, a California-based National Cancer Institute-designated organization with a
                century-long reputation of compassionate patient care and cutting-edge research.
                While we await several key government and regulatory approvals for this to take
                place, I wanted to be the first to let you know of our intentions and the profoundly
                positive impact this will have on you, both organizations, and the transformation of
                the future of cancer care.&nbsp;<br />
                &nbsp;<br />
                We are confident that through this joining of forces, patients will experience
                greater access to clinical trials and research and the physicians who lead them,
                expanded services and treatment options, and additional resources for new
                innovations in cancer care delivery and technology. Your physicians and care teams
                will not change and will help evolve the combined shared culture and mission to
                provide quality and compassionate care for people fighting cancer. &nbsp;<br />
                &nbsp;<br />
                We are excited about the opportunity to combine our over three decades of
                unparalleled patient experience and quality care with City of Hope&rsquo;s
                century-long dedication to combining science with humanity. We will keep you updated
                as we make additional progress toward this exciting next chapter in the history of
                CTCA. &nbsp;<br />
                &nbsp;<br />
                As always, we are grateful that you have entrusted us with your care and for
                allowing us the honor to fight alongside you in your cancer journey.&nbsp;<br />
