                    should be on your calendar. As you may know, screening is one of the most
                    powerful tools available to reduce cancer risk, including the risk of a
                    recurrence or second cancer.<br />
                    <br />
                    If you&rsquo;re like more than two-thirds of Americans*, you delayed or
                    cancelled screening appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic. While your doctor
                    may recommend waiting on certain screenings if you&rsquo;re in active treatment,
                    you can book appointments in advance. It&rsquo;s much easier to reschedule a
                    screening than to remember to book it.
