                        Many patients worry about how cancer will impact their lives, from how they
                        physically feel to how they will manage everyday responsibilities. At
                        CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup>, our integrative approach not only treats the disease,
                        but also addresses your strength, stamina and quality of life. All of our
                        doctors and clinicians work together regularly with you and one another,
                        monitoring your progress and adjusting your care plan when necessary.
