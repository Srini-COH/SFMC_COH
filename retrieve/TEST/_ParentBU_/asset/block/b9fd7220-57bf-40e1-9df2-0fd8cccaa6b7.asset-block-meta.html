                <br />If you decide that you would like to pursue treatment at CTCA &reg;, I
                recommend contacting your employer to ask about alternative insurance plans they may
                offer for out-of-network providers. It's possible that a PPO policy would allow you
                to go out-of-network and may cover the cost of treatment at CTCA. Employers
                typically host open enrollment for health insurance every fall. However, each
                employer is different, so be sure to contact your employer&rsquo;s benefits
                department for the most accurate information.
