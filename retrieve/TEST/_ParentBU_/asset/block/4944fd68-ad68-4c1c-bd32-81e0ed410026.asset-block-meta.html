                        Many patients tell me they worry about how cancer treatment will impact
                        their daily life. In recent years, advances in cancer research have led to
                        new types of treatment that precisely target and destroy cancer cells in
                        ways that often produce fewer side effects. Patients at Cancer Treatment
                        Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) benefit from these treatments
                        every day.
