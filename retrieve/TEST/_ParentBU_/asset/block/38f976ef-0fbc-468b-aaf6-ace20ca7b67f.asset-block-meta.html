                        Many patients worry about if a cancer therapy will work for them and what
                        impact it will have on their quality of life. Cancer treatment has
                        progressed rapidly, and now, new diagnostic testing and treatments have been
                        designed to more precisely target cancer cells in ways that often produce
                        fewer side effects. It's one of the many benefits we offer our patients at
                        Cancer Treatment Centers of America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA).
