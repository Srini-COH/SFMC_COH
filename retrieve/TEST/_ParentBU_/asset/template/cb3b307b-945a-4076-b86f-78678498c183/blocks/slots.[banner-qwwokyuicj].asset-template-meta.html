                        Unlike the fatigue most people may experience, cancer-related fatigue is a
                        much more persistent exhaustion that cannot be relieved simply with a good
                        night's rest. At Cancer Treatment Centers of America ® (CTCA), we have
                        teams of experts who work together with you to proactively manage side
                        effects, including cancer-related fatigue. From our nutrition therapy team
                        to our mind-body medicine team, CTCA ® provides many supportive therapies

                        fatigue. When side effects are minimized, you are more likely to feel
                        strong, empowered and optimistic.
