                        <br />As we discussed, your next step is to complete the CTCA Medical
                        History and Release of Information forms. It is critical for you to complete
                        these forms within 24 hours so that we can obtain your records and to avoid
                        any delays in scheduling your evaluation.

                        <!-- This process is easy to do online using the link below. If you do not have some of the information requested, simply save your work and return to it later.
