                help find cancer at an early stage, before symptoms appear or abnormal cells can
                turn into cancer. That makes screening one of the most powerful tools you have to
                reduce your cancer risk.<br />
                <br />
                If you&rsquo;re like more than two-thirds of Americans*, you delayed or cancelled
                screening appointments―mammogram, colonoscopy, PAP/HPV test, skin check or other
                screening―during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now it&rsquo;s critical to get back on
                track. Start today with the Cancer Screening Tracker.</span
