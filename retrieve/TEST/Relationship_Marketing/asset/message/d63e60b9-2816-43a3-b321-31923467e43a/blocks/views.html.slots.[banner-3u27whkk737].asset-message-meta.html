                        <br />If you decide that you would like to pursue treatment at
                        CTCA<sup>&reg;</sup>, I recommend contacting your employer to ask about
                        alternative insurance plans they may offer for out-of-network providers.
                        It's possible that a PPO policy would allow you to go out-of-network and may
                        cover the cost of treatment at CTCA. Employers typically host open
                        enrollment for health insurance every fall. However, each employer is
                        different, so be sure to contact your employer’s benefits department for the
                        most accurate information.
