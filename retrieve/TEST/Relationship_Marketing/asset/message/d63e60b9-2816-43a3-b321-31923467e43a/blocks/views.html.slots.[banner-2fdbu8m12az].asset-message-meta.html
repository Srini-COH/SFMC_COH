                        <br />I want to thank you for contacting Cancer Treatment Centers of
                        America<sup>&reg;</sup> (CTCA) about your treatment options. I understand
                        that navigating insurance policies can be overwhelming after receiving a
                        cancer diagnosis, and I want to help you find a treatment provider that is
                        right for you.

                        <br />Many organizations offer information and assistance to people living
                        with cancer, but it's sometimes hard to know what resources can offer
                        reliable and trustworthy support.
