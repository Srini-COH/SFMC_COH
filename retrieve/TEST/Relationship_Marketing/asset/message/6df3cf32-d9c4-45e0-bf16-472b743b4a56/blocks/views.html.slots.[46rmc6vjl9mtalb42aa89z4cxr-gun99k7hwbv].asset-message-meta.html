                    If you answered yes to any of these questions, you may be coping with
                    cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), also known as &quot;chemo
                    brain,&quot; and you're not alone. Recent research shows that more than half of
                    patients with cancer report having some sort of cognitive change during or after
                    treatment.<br />
                    <br />
                    It's possible to train your brain and mental focus capabilities with specific
                    activities to help overcome these obstacles:</span
