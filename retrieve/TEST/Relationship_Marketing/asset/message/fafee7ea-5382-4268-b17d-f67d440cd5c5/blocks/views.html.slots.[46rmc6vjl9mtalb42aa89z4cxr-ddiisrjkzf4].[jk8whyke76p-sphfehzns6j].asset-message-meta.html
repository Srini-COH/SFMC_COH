                Screenings help find cancer at an early stage, before symptoms appear. That makes
                screening one of the most powerful tools you have to reduce your risk of a second
                cancer or a recurrence.<br />

                If you&rsquo;re like more than two-thirds of Americans*, you delayed or cancelled
                screening appointments―mammogram, colonoscopy, PAP/HPV test, skin check or other
                screening―during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now it&rsquo;s critical to get back on
                track. Start today with the Cancer Screening Tracker.
