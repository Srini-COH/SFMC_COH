  It's critical for you to complete these forms quickly so that we can obtain your records. Without completing this step right away, there may be delays that would require rescheduling your evaluation.
  <p>After completion, you'll receive an email from Adobe Sign. You must open the Adobe Sign email and click the link in that email as requested to complete the process. To be sure the email does not get blocked as spam, please add <a href="mailto:echosign@echosign.com" style="color: #00A9E0; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">echosign@echosign.com</a> to your email contacts list.</p>
