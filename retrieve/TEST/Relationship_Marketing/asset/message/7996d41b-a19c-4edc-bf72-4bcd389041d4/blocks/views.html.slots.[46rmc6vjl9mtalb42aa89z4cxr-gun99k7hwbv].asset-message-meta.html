                    necessarily mean you'll develop the diseases, too, but it's a possibility if you
                    have an inherited risk. That's why it's important to talk to your family to
                    learn more about any health issues you may face in the future.<br />
                    <br />
                    Keeping a detailed family history, especially going back a few generations, can
                    help you and your doctor to establish a prevention plan that suits your needs.
